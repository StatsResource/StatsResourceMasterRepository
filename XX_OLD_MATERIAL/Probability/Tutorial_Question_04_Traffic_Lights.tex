Question 3
c) Calculate the probability of obtaining exactly 2 sixes when I roll a die 5 times.
(4 marks)

\noindent \textbf{Worked Example}\\
A worker-operated machine produces a defective item with probability 0.01 if the worker follows the machineâ€™s operating instructions exactly, and with probability 0.04 if he does not. If the worker follows the instructions 90\% of the time, what is the probability that an item produced by the machine, selected at random, will be defective?
