* A coin is tossed 100 times. Using the appropriate approximating distribution, estimate the probability that
a) exactly 46 heads are thrown
b) between 48 and 59 heads (inclusively) are thrown.
\itemI obtain a hand of 13 cards. Calculate the probability of
i) obtaining 2 aces.
ii) obtaining 2 aces and 2 kings.
iii) obtaining 2 aces or 2 kings.



* The probabilities with which Liverpool win, draw or lose a premier league match are 0.5, 0.3 and 0.2, respectively. Calculate the probability that in 8 matches
i)Liverpool lose 2 matches.
ii)Liverpool win 5 matches and draw 2.

If A and B are events such that $P(A|B^c) = 2P(A|B)$ and $P(B^c) = 2P(B)$.
(The event $B^c$ is the complement of event B.) Compute the probability: $P(B^c|A)$ 
\begin{framed}
--- 
* Complement events: $P(B^c) = 1 - P(B)$. Also we are told $P(B^c) = 1-P(B)= 2P(B)$
* Necessarily $1 = 3P(B)$. Therefore $P(B) = 1/3$ and  $P(B^c)=2/3$
* Total Probability: $P(A) = P(A \mbox{ and } B) + P(A \mbox{ and } B^c)$
