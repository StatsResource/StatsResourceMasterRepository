--- 
* The discrete uniform distribution
* The continuous uniform distribution
* The binomial disribution
* The poisson distribution
* The exponential distribution
* the Normal distribution


%* uniform - The lower and upper bounds are 13cm and 21cm respectively.

%* A computer server breaks down, on average, once every three months.
--- 
* What is the probability that the server breaks down three times in a quarter?
* What is the probability that a server breaks down exactly five times in one year?


Assume that the number of weekly study hours for students at a certain university
is approximately normally distributed with a mean of 22 and a standard deviation
of 6.
--- 
* Find the probability that a randomly chosen student studies less than 12
hours.
* Estimate the percentage of students that study more than 37 hours.



%A charity believes that when it puts out an appeal for charitable donations the donations it receives 
%will normally distributed with a mean 50 and 
%
%standard deviation 6, and
%
% it is assumed that donations will be independent of each other.
%
%---  
%* Find the probability that the first donation it receives will be less than40.
%
%* Compute the probability that it will be between 40and 45.
%* Compute the value $x$ such that 5\% of donations are more than $x$.

In an examination the scores of students who attend schools of type A are
normally distributed about a mean of 55 with a standard deviation of 6. The
scores of students who attend type B schools are normally distributed about a
mean of 60 with a standard deviation of 5.
Which type of school would have a higher proportion of students with marks above 70?

\begin{enumerate}
* Summarize the data in the above table using a frequency table. Use 6 class intervals, with 140 as the lower limit of the first interval.
* Draw a histogram for the above data.
* Comment on the shape of the histogram. Based on the shape of the histogram, what is the best measure of centrality and variability?
* Construct a box plot for the above data. Clearly demonstrate how all of the necessary values were computed.
