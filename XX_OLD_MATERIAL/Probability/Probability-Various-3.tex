* A fair coin is tossed four times.
Let X denote the longest string of heads.
Find the distribution and expectation of X.
* 
A fair coin is tossed until a head or five tails occurs.
Find the expected number E of tosses of the coin.

* A coin is weighted so that $P(H) = 0.75$ and $P(T ) = 0.25$

The coin is tossed three times. Let X denote the number of
heads that appear.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
*  Find the distribution f of X.
*  Find the expectation E(X).

* 
A box contains two gold balls and three silver balls. 
--- 
* You are allowed to choose
successively balls from the box at random. 
* You win 1 dollar each time you
draw a gold ball and lose 1 dollar each time you draw a silver ball.
