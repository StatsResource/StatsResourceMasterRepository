Sample Space: This is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment, and is denoted $S$. An element in $S$ is called a sample point.
Each outcome of a random experiment corresponds to a sample point.
Find the sample space for the experiment of tossing a coin (a) one and (b) twice.
(a) There are two possible outcomes: heads or tails.
Thus
S= {H,T}where $H$ and $T$ represent head and tail respectively.
(b) There are four possible outcomes, which are pairs of heads and tails.
Thus S= {HH,HT,TH,TT}

Considering a coin toss experiment. A fair coin is tossed three times.
Let X be the random variable that counts the number of heads in each sample point.
P(X\leq 1)
P(X\>1)
p(0<X<3)
Set of Eligible outcomes = \{1,2\}
