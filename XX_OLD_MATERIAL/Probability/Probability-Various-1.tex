%=========================%

A doctor treating a patient issues a prescription for antibiotics and provides for two repeat prescriptions. 
--- 
    * The probability that the infection will be cleared by the first prescription is $p_1$ =0.6.
* The probability that successive treatments are successful, given that previous prescriptions were not successful are $p_2$ = 0.5, $p_3$ = 0.4.
 Calculate the probability that:

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
* a patient will require the third prescription,
* the patient is still infected after the third prescription,
* the patient is cured by the third prescription, given that the patient is eventually cured.
\end{enumerate}
