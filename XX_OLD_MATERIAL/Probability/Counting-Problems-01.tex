\noindent \textbf{Useful:} Binomial Probability Tree 
--- 
* All possible Outcomes:
$\{ (HHH), (HHT), (HTH), (HTT) , (THH), (THT), (TTH),(TTT)\} $



* ``More Heads than Tails" means 2 or 3 Heads. Sample space from above written in terms of numbers f Heads: $\{ (3), (2), (2), (1), (2),(1),(1),(0)\} $

\[ \Pr(\mbox{More Heads than Tails} = \Pr(\mbox{2 Heads}) + \Pr(\mbox{3 Heads}) = 3/8 + 1/8 \]

* $ \Pr(\mbox{2 Heads}) = 3/8 $
