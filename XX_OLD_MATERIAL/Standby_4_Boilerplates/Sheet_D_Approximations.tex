\noindent When the value of $n$ in a binomial distribution is large and the value of $p$ is very small, the binomial distribution can be approximated by a Poisson distribution, if the following conditions are met:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $n > 20$ 
        \item $p <0.05$
    \item $np < 5$ OR $n(1-p) < 5$

\end{itemize} 
The binomial distribution with parameters $(n, p)$ is approximated by the Poisson distribution with $\lambda = np$).
