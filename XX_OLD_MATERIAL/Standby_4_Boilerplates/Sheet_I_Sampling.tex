\noindent The sampling distribution of the sample variance is a chi-squared distribution with degree of freedom equals to $n-1$, where $n$ is the sample size (given that the random variable of interest is normally distributed).
\\
\\
\noindent The sampling distribution is characterized by the following:
\[ \frac{(n-1)S^2}{\sigma^2}  \sim \chi^{2}_{n-1}\]

%- Sampling Distributions - Chi Squared

\begin{framed}
\large
\noindent The chi-square distribution (with degrees of freedom $\nu$) has the following properties:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The mean of the distribution is equal to the number of degrees of freedom: $\mu = \nu$. 
    \item The variance is equal to two times the number of degrees of freedom: $\sigma^2 = 2\nu$.
\end{itemize}
