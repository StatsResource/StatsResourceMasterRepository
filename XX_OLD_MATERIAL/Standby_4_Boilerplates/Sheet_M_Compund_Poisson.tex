		\noindent A compound Poisson distribution is the probability distribution of the sum of a number of independent identically-distributed random variables, where the number of terms to be added is itself a Poisson-distributed variable. In the simplest cases, the result can be either a continuous or a discrete distribution. \\
		
		\noindent When $N$ is Poisson, the expected value and the variance of the compound distribution are
		
		\[ {\displaystyle \operatorname {E} (Y)=\operatorname {E} (N)\operatorname {E} (X),} \] . \[{\displaystyle \operatorname {Var} (Y)=E(N)(\operatorname {Var} (X)+{E(X)}^{2})=E(N){E(X^{2})}.} \]
