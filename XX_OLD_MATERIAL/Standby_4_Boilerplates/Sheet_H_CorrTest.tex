Testing using Student's t-distribution

Critical values of Pearson's correlation coefficient that must be exceeded to be considered significantly nonzero at the 0.05 level.
For pairs from an uncorrelated bivariate normal distribution, the sampling distribution of a certain function of Pearson's correlation coefficient follows Student's t-distribution with degrees of freedom $n - 2$. 

Specifically, if the underlying variables are white and have a bivariate normal distribution, the variable

\[{\displaystyle t=r{\sqrt {\frac {n-2}{1-r^{2}}}}} \]
has a Student's t-distribution in the null case (zero correlation). 
This holds approximately in case of non-normal observed values if sample sizes are large enough.
