\section{Computer Output}
Statistical Procedures were performed using a statistical programming language called $R$.
A brief description of each procedure is provided. For each procedures, identify the null and alternative hypotheses, the $p-$value, and your conclusion for this test.


\begin{itemize}
\item If the $p-$value is less than 0.05 : reject the null hypothesis.
\item If the $p-$value is greater than 0.05 : fail to reject the null hypothesis.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Question 11 - Shapiro-Wilk Test}
Interpret the output from the three Shapiro-Wilk tests. What is the null and alternative hypotheses? State your conclusion for each of the three tests.
