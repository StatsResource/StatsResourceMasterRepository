Logistic regression
 SA heart data
 
this data set is available in the elemstatlearn package
 fit a logistic regression model where the chd us the binary outcome, and all other variables are used as predictor variables
 
use the AIC criterion

ANOVA with R
 
The null hypothesis is that population mean is the same for each of the groups.
 
The alternative hypothesis is that there is at least  one group with a different population mean diffetent to the rest
 
the first tjing we do is to re-write the data in long form
 
Important :remember to construct tbe grouping variable as a factor. 


<hr>
Categorical variables are referred to by R (and in fact several branches of statistics as "factors". 

The categories for a factor are known as levels. 

Sex is an example of a factor variables, where the levels are Male and Female. 

Factors differ from character vectors. R woyld nit recognize a character variable as indicating membership of a category, rather it would just identify it as a piece of text..


 
-------------------------------------------

 
When computing confidence intervals or performing hypothesis tests, the most computationally complex component is the calculation of the standard error.
 
For each procedure, there is a standard error formula. These are usually given in an appendix to examination papers. It is strongly recommended that you familiarise yourself with these before your exam.



Scatterplots are useful for determining outliers. There is no single definition of an outlier, rather it depends on the type of analysis being used.

Medical statistic hypothesis testing
 
Type I error This describes a hypothesis test in which the null hypothesis was rejected, when it should not have been. 

Type II error This describes a hypothesis test in which the null hypothesis was rejected when it was in fact true.
