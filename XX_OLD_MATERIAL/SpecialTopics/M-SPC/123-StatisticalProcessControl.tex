\section{Statistical Process Control}
A normally distributed quality characteristic is monitored through the use of control charts. These charts have the 
following parameters. All charts are in control.
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline  & LCL & Centre Line & UCL \\ 
\hline $\bar{X}$-Chart & 542 & 550 & 558 \\ 
\hline $R$-Chart & 0 & 8.236 & 16.504 \\ 
\hline 
\end{tabular} 
\begin{itemize}
\item What sample size is being used?
\item Estimate the standard deviation of this process.
\item Compute the control limits for the $s$-chart.
\end{itemize}
