\subsubsection{Worked Example Confidence intervals: example}

\noindent A random sample of 25 female students is chosen from
students at higher education establishments in a particular area
of a country, and it is found that their mean height is 165
centimeters with sample variance of 81.
\\
\\
Assuming that the distribution of the heights of the students may
be regarded as normally distributed, calculate a 95\% confidence
interval for the mean height of female students.
\\
\\
You are asked to obtain a 98\% confidence interval for the mean
height of width 3 centimeters. What sample size would be needed in
order to achieve that degree of accuracy?

\noindent \textbf{Solution 1}

\begin{itemize}
\item Confidence interval formula: $\bar{X} \pm t_{(\alpha/2,df)}
\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$.

\item Small sample, therefore degrees of freedom = 24 (i.e. n-1).

\item 95\% confidence, therefore $\alpha = 5\% (i.e. 0.05)$

\item Correct t value from tables: $t_{(\alpha /2,n-1)} =
t_{0.025,24} $

\item Interval computed: $165 \pm 1.96 \frac{9}{\sqrt{25}}  =
(160:09; 169:91).$
\end{itemize}


\noindent \textbf{Solution 2}

\begin{itemize}
\item Confidence interval width is 3, so half-width is 1.5

\item Seek n such that $1.96 \times \frac{9}{\sqrt{n}} = 1.5$

\item Divide both sides by $1.96 \times 9$ \\
\[\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{1.5}{1.96 \times 9} =\]


\item invert and square boths sides.
\end{itemize}
