\section*{Worked Example  - Defective Electronics}
Suppose an electronics assembly subcontractor receives resistors from only two suppliers: A and B.

\begin{itemize}
\item Suppose we are told that Supplier A supplies 80\% of the resistors



\end{itemize}

\begin{framed}
\begin{itemize}
\item Supplier A supplies 80\% of the resistors.
{


\item \textit{Probability that a randomly chosen resistor comes from A is 80 \%} : \textit{P(A) = 0.80 }

}
\item Supplier B supplies 20\% of the resistors
\item \textit{Probability that a randomly chosen resistor comes from B is therefore 20\%} : \textit{P(B) = 0.20}
\end{itemize}
\end{framed}



\begin{itemize}
\item We are giving information about the rate of faulty components from each supplier. \\(Faulty : resistor fails some 
\item 1\% of the resistors supplied by A are faulty

\item 3\% of the resistors supplied by B are faulty 
\vspace{1cm}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item We are giving information about the rate of faulty components from each supplier. \\(Faulty : resistor fails some quality test)
\item  \textit{P(F) probability that randomly selecting compoent is faulty}
\item 1\% of the resistors supplied by A are faulty.
\item\textit{ We write this as $P(F|A) =0.01$}
\item 3\% of the resistors supplied by B are faulty 
\item \textit{We write this as $P(F|B) =0.03$}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Question 1:}
\begin{itemize}
\item What is the probability that a randomly selected resistor fails the final test?

\item In mathematical terms, compute P(F) 
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Law of Total Probability:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Faulty Resistors are either from Supplier A or Supplier B.
\vspace{0.3cm} 
\item \textit{Resistors MUST come from one of the two suppliers.}
\item \textit{A and B are mutually exclusive.}
\end{itemize}

\[ P(F) = P(F \mbox{ and } A) + P(F \mbox{ and } B) \]
