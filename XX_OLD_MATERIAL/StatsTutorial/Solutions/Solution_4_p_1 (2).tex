\subsection{Poisson Distribution Question}

A motor dealership which specializes in agricultural machinery sells on vehicle every 2 days, on average


In this question the unit period is one day. The company expects to sell, on average, 0.5 vehicles every day.

The Poisson mean $m$ is therefore 0.5.


\[P(X \geq 1)\]


\begin{itemize}
\item Go to your Poisson tables, and search for the $m=0.5$ column.

\item We are interested in the probability of \textbf{exactly} one vehicle sold on a particular day.

\item From the tables we can easily work out $P(X \geq 1)$, but this is probability of one or more vehicles being sold.

\item This is not the same thing.
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
\item
$P(X \geq 1) = P(X =1) + P( X=2) + P(X=3) + \ldots$
\item 
$P(X \geq 1) = P(X=1) + P(X \geq 2)$
\end{itemize}
From tables
\begin{itemize}
\item$P(X \geq 1)$
\item$P(X \geq 2)$
\end{itemize}

Six day working week?
our unit period is now six days.
How many vehicles do we expect to sell in 6 days?
answer = 3

$m=3$


$P(X\geq 4)$
