\section*{Question 4} 


The following contingency table shows the age and sex of derby winners





 \begin{tabular}{ccc}
Age	&	Stallion	&	Total	 \\ \hline


age =3	&	10	&	30	 \\ \hline


age =4 	&	30	&	50	 \\ \hline


age =5	&	20	&	30	 \\ \hline


Total	&	60	&	110	 \\ \hline

\end{tabular}







A winner is chosen at random. Calculate the probability that

\begin{enumerate}
\item the horse is a filly
\item the horse won as a 5-year old.
\item the horse was a stallion, given it won as a 3-year old
\item the horse was a 4-year old, given it was a filly.
\end{enumerate}





Solutions


110 derby winners. 50 winners were fillies.                                              answer (i) = 50/110 = 45.45 %


30 winners were 5 years old                                                    answer (ii) = 30/110 = 27.27%



30 winners were three year olds. Of that 30, 10 were stallions.       

answer (iii) = 10/30 = 33.33%


50 winners were fillies. Of that 50, 20 were 4 year olds                                                  answer (iv) = 20/50 = 40%
