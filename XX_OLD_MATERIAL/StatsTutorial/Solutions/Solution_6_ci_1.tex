The operating life of a laptop battery produced by a firm is assumed to approximately normally distributed.
A sample of 64 batteries are tests and the meam lifetime is found to be be 14000 hours, with a sample standard deviation os 600 hours. Compute a $95\%$ confidence interval for the population mean.
\begin{itemize}
\item $\bar{x}$ = 14000 hours
\item sample stadard deviation $s$ = 600 hours
\item sample size n= 64
\item $\mbox{S.E} (\bar{x})$ = ${s \over \sqrt{n} } $ = ${600 \over \sqrt{64}}$ = 75 hours
\end{itemize}
\[  \bar{x} \pm \]
