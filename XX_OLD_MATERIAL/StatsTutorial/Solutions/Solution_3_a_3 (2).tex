Question 4


\begin{verbatim}
Events 
A components from supplier A  	P (A) = 0.8 
B components from supplier B  	P (B) = 0.2 
F = resistor fails test

1\% Probability of a Failure given that component is from Supplier A.      P(F|A) = 0.01
3\% Probability of a Failure given that component is from Supplier B.      P(F|B) = 0.03

\end{verbatim}
Probability of flaw : P(F)
Failed resistors either come from A or B
\[	P( F) =  P ( F \mbox{ and } A)  +  P( F \mbox{ and } B)\]
Use conditional Probability  rule		
\[P(F) = P(F|A)\times P(A)  + P(F|B)\times P(B)\]

\[P(F)  =  ( 0.01 x 0.8 ) + ( 0.03 x 0.2) = (0.008) + (0.06) = 0.014	\]
	Answer 1.4%

Part ii
Given that a component failed, what was the probability of coming from A
P(A|F) 

P(A|F) = P(A and F)  / P(F)		We found P(A and F) earlier ; 0.008

P(A|F) = 0.008/0.014 =  0.57			[answer : 57%]
