\subsection{Hypothesis Test for a proportion }

\begin{itemize}
\item Suppose we want to test whether or not the true proportion of programmers using python as their primary programming language is $40\%$
\item We would write the null and alternative hypothesis as follows
\begin{description}
\item[$H_0$] $\pi = 40\%$ True proportion is $40\%$
\item[$H_1$] $\pi \neq 40\%$ True proportion is not $40\%$
\end{description}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item The Standard Error is computed as
\[S.E.(p) \;=\; \sqrt{ {40 \times 60 \over 160 }} =  3.87\%\]
\item The test statistic is computed as
\[TS = \frac{\mbox{Observed} - \mbox{Null}}{S.E.(p)} = \frac{35-40}{3.87} = -1.29\]
\item The Critical Value is 1.96 (same as quantile from computation of confidence interval previously).
\item Decision Rule : $|TS| > CV$? No - We fail to reject null hypothesis. Not enough evidence to contradict claim that true proportion is 40\%.
\end{itemize}
