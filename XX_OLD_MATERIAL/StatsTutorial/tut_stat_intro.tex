\item 

A manager wants to estimate the proportion of faulty resistors produced (in a particular week). Individual units are selected at random times during the morning shift of each day and then tested for faults. In total 1520 resistors were tested and 18 if these were found to be faulty.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item What is the population?
\item What is the sample?
\item What is the parameter? What symbol do we use? What is its value?
\item What is the statistic? What symbol do we use? What is its value?
\item Identify any potential bias.
\end{enumerate}



\item
ITD wish to determine the duration of time that a UL student spends on Facebook each day. They send an email of enquiry to 500 students (by randomly selecting ID numbers) - 286 students respond. The mean time spent on Facebook in this sample was found to be 1.5 hours per day.

\item What is the population?
\item What is the sample?
\item What is the parameter? What symbol do we use? What is its value?
\item What is the statistic? What symbol do we use? What is its value?
\item Identify any potential bias.

\item A researcher wants to know if the Irish public are in support of a new government policy - she believes that less than 30\% of the public support it. She wishes to test this hypothesis by carrying out a survey. From a list of all individuals living in her local area, shes draws a random sample of 80 individuals and finds that 23 are in favour.\\[-0.2cm]

{\bf(a)} What is the population?\quad {\bf(b)} What is the sample?\quad {\bf(c)} What is the value of $n$?\quad \\{\bf(d)} Identify the the parameter and statistic - give the symbol and value for both.\quad {\bf(e)} What type of data was collected on each of the individuals in the sample? \quad {\bf(f)}  Identify any potential bias.\quad {\bf(g)} Can we confirm her hypothesis?

Employees of a software firm were each assigned the task of developing a tool. Once completed, they each submitted their code and executable file. A number of details were recorded:\\[-0.2cm]

{\bf(a)} The number of lines of code.\quad {\bf(b)} Time taken to develop the tool. \quad {\bf(c)} Experience level of the employee (high, average, low). \quad {\bf(d)} The size of the executable file (megabytes).\quad \\ {\bf(e)} Does the tool work?
