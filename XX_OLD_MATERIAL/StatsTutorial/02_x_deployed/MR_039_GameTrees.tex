\item In a game show, contestants M\'{a}ire and S\'{e}amus start the last round with \euro{500} and \euro{400} respectively. Each must decide to pass or play. If a player passes, they keep their money but if they opt to play they win or lose \euro{200} each with probability 1/2. These outcomes are independent of each other. The player with the most money at the end of the round gets a bonus of \euro{300}.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item[(a)] If M\'{a}ire goes first and S\'{e}amus sees her move, draw the game tree.

%- Question 52

\item  In a game show, contestants S\'{i}le and S\'{e}an start the last round with \euro{500} and \euro{400} respectively. Each must decide to pass or play. If a player passes, they keep their money but if they opt to play they win or lose \euro{200} each with probability 1/2. These outcomes are independent of each other. The player with the most money at the end of the round gets a bonus of \euro{200}.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item[(a)] Suppose S\'{i}le goes first, with S\'{e}an then taking his turn, after seeing her move. Draw the game tree. 
	\item[(b)] Show that the strategic form of the game is
	
	\begin{center}
		
		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
			\hline
			& Pass         &Play       \\
			\hline
			Pass & (7,4) &$\left(6, 5 \right)$  \\
			\hline
			Play & $\left(6, 5 \right)$ & $\left(\frac{9}{2}, 5\right)$ \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	where payoffs are expected values in 00's. 
	\item[(c)] Solve the game using Backward Induction.
