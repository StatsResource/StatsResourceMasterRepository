\section*{Hypothesis Testing Tutorial Sheet 1: Single Sample Tests}

\begin{enumerate}
%D Hypothesis Testing - Example
\item The catering manager in a hotel suspects that the weight of loaves of bread delivered
daily by a bakery is consistently below the nominal weight of 800g. To test this,
10 loaves chosen at random from a dayâ€™s deliveries are weighed. The mean and
standard deviation of the ten weights are 792g and 25g, respectively.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Carry out a formal significance test.
\item List the steps involved in this test 
\item Calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the average weight of loaves produced
\item Comment on the correspondence between the interval, as calculated, and the
result of the test.
\end{enumerate}
