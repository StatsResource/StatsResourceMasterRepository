\begin{enumerate}



\item 

Assume that a character in a game is programmed to have an attack power according to $X \sim \text{Normal}(\mu=40,\sigma=3)$.\\[-0.2cm]



\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item What is the probability that the attack is greater than 45? \item What is the probability that the attack is between 32 and 42? \item Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be the first and second attacks. What is the probability that the \emph{sum} of these two attacks is greater than 85 units? \quad \item Calculate 99\% limits for the sum of two attacks.  \item What is the probability that the \emph{difference} in attacks is more than 5 units? Note that attack 2 can be 5 units more than attack 1 or attack 1 can be 5 units more than attack 2, i.e., $\Pr(|D|>5)=\Pr(D<-5) + \Pr(D>5)$.

\end{enumerate}

\item A character in a game deals a standard attack 75\% of the time and a critical attack the rest of the time (call these events $S$ and $S^c$). Given that it is a standard attack, the attack power is $X\,|\,S \sim \text{Normal}(\mu=40,\sigma=3)$. When the character deals a critical attack, a random fluctuation is added to this according to a $\text{Normal}(\mu=5,\sigma=1)$ distribution.\\[-0.2cm]



\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item What is the distribution of $X\,|\,S^c$? \item Calculate $\Pr(X<43\,|\,S)$ and $\Pr(X<43\,|\,S^c)$. \item Calculate $\Pr(X<43)$. \,\, (hint: law of total probability) \item If the character deals less than 43 damage points, what is the probability that the attack was a critical attack?

\end{enumerate}

\item 

The income of a technician (in thousands) is $X_1 \sim \text{Normal}(\mu=30,\sigma=2)$. The income of an engineer is $X_2 \sim \text{Normal}(\mu=40,\sigma=3.5)$. 

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item Calculate the probability that an engineer earns more than a technician. \item Calculate 90\% limits for the difference in their income. \item For a group of 25 technicians, calculate the probability that the average wage is less than 30500, i.e., $\Pr(\,\overline{\!X}_1 < 30.5)$. \item In a group of 10 engineers, what is the probability that \emph{at least two} of them earn more than 45000? (hint: binomial with $p = \Pr(X_2 > 45)$) \item For a sample of 30 technicians and 35 engineers, calculate the 80\% limits for the difference in their average wages.

\end{enumerate}

\item 

Let $X \sim \text{Normal}(\mu=10,\sigma=2)$. Calculate the following:

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item $\Pr(X>10)$. \item $\Pr(X<3)$. \item $\Pr(X>8.4)$. \item $\Pr(6<X<14)$. \item The value of $x$ such that $\Pr(X>x)$ = 0.3. \item The value of $x$ such that $\Pr(X>x)$ = 0.8.

\end{enumerate}

\item 

Assume that speeds of cars on a motorway have a normal distribution with mean 115km/hr and standard deviation 4km/hr.\\[-0.2cm]

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item Draw a rough sketch of the distribution. \item $\Pr(X>120)=$ ? \item $\Pr(X<100)=$ ? \item $\Pr(100<X<110)=$ ? \item 1\% of drivers travel above what speed?

\end{enumerate}
