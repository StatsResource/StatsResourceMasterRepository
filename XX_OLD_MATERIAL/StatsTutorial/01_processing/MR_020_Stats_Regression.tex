\subsection*{Descriptive Statistics}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Sample Variance

\subsection*{Probability}
\begin{itemize}
	
	\item Conditional probability:

	P(B|A)=\frac{P\left( A\text{ and }B\right) }{P\left( A\right) }.
	\end{equation*}
	
	
	\item Bayes' Theorem:
	\begin{equation*}
	P(B|A)=\frac{P\left(A|B\right) \times P(B) }{P\left( A\right) }.
	\end{equation*}

	%	\end{equation*}
	%	
	%	\item Exponential probability distribution:
	%	\begin{equation*}
	%		P(X \leq k) = \begin{cases}
	%			1-e^{- k/\mu}, & k \ge 0, \\
