The strength of dosage of a plant growth enhancement chemical is often measured by the proportion of plants that grow faster. A particular dosage of the chemical is fed to 124 plants of these plants, 104 actually show faster growth.

\begin{itemize}
	\item[i.] (1 Mark) Calculate a point estimate $\hat{p}$ for the proportion of plants that grow faster due to the dosage. 									 
	\item[ii.] (2 Marks)  What is the standard error of the estimate? 			
	\item[iii.] (2 Marks) Find a 95\% confidence interval for the proportion.
