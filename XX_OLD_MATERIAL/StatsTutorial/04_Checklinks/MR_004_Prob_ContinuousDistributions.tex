%% RSS HC2 2014 Question 2. 
 
\item The continuous random variable X has probability density function (pdf) $f(x)$ given by

\[ f(x) = \frac{k}{x^4},  \mbox{ where} x= \geq \theta\]
where $\theta$ is a positive constant.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item  Find k in terms of $\theta$. For the case $\theta$ = 1, sketch the graph of $f(x)$, marking the value of $f(1)$ on your graph. (6)
\item  Show that $E(X) = \frac{3}{2}\theta$ and $Var(X) = \frac{3}{4} \theta^2$.
 
\item Let X denote the mean of n independent random variables, $X_1, X_2,\ldots X_n$, each of which has the pdf $f(x)$.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Write down an approximation to the distribution of X based on the central limit theorem. How would you expect the success of the approximation to vary with $n$? 
\item Use this distribution to show that $$P\left( |X - E(X)| \; \leq \; 1.96 \theta \sqrt{\frac{3}{4n}} \right)$$ approximately. Hence find an approximation to the least value of n such that $$P\left( |X - E(X)| \; \leq \; 0.1 \theta  \right) \geq 0.95 . $$

    \item 

 The random variable Y has probability density function
\[f ( y) = k( y - y^3 ) \qquad  \mbox{ where } \;\;0 \leq y \leq 2, \]
and zero otherwise, where k is a positive constant.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Show that $k = 1/6$.
\item Show that the cumulative distribution function is
  \[
    f(y) = \begin{cases}
        0, & \text{for } y \leq 0\\
        \frac{y^2}{12}\left( \frac{y^2+2}{2} \right)  & \text{for } 0 < y < 2\\
        1, & \text{for }  y\geq 2
        \end{cases} 
  \]
\item 
Hence find $P( 1/2 < Y < 3/2)$?
\item  Find the variance of $Y$.

\item  The continuous random variable $X$ has probability density function given by

$$f_X(x) = c(1-x^2), \mbox{ where } â€“1\leq x \leq 1,$$

where $$c$$ is a suitable constant.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item Show that $c = 3/4$ and plot the graph of $f_X(x)$ against $x$.

\item Show that the cumulative distribution function of X is given by

 \[
    f(x) = \begin{cases}
        0, & \text{for } x \leq -1\\
        \frac{2 + 3x - x^2}{4}  & \text{for } -1 < x < 1\\
