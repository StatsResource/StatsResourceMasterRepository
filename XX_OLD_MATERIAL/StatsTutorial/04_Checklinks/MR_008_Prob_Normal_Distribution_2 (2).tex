\begin{enumerate}

\item Assume that the length of injected moulded plastic components are normally distributed with a mean of 100mm and a standard deviation of 4mm.  Draw a rough sketch and then calculate corresponding probability for the following measurements occurring on an individual component:

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Between 100 and 104.4mms
\item Less than 97 mms
\item Between 98.2 and 101.6 mms
\item Less than 103.8 mms
\end{enumerate}

\item Assume that $Z$ scores are normally distributed with a mean of Zero and a
standard deviation of 1.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Given $P (0\leq  Z \leq  a)  =  0.1915$  Find   a 
\item $P(- b\leq  Z \leq  b) =  0.90$             Find   b
\item $P(Z \leq c)  =       0.3085$  Find   c
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
