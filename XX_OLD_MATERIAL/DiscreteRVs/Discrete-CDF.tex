\frametitle{The Cumulative Distribution Function}
\begin{itemize}
\item The Cumulative Distribution Function, denoted $F(x)$, is a common way that the probabilities
of a random variable (both discrete and continuous) can be summarized.
\item The Cumulative Distribution Function, which also can be
described by a formula or summarized in a table, is defined as:
\[F(x) = P(X \leq x) \]
\item The notation for a cumulative distribution function, F(x), entails using a capital
"F".  (The notation for a probability mass or density function, f(x), i.e. using a lowercase "f". The notation is not interchangeable.
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Useful Results}
(Demonstration on the blackboard re: partitioning of the sample space, using examples on next slide)
\begin{itemize}
\item $P(X \leq 1) = P(X=0) + P(X=1)$
\item $P(X \leq r) = P(X=0)+ P(X=1) + \ldots P(X= r)$
\item $P(X \leq 0) = P(X=0)$
\item $P(X = r) = P(X \geq r ) - P(X \geq r + 1)$
\item \textbf{Complement Rule}: $P(X \leq r-1) = P(X < r) = 1 - P(X \geq r)$
\item \textbf{Interval Rule}:$ P(a \leq X \leq  b)= P(X \geq a) - P(X \geq b + 1).$
\end{itemize}
For the binomial distribution, if the probability of success is greater than 0.5, instead of
considering the number of successes, to use the table we consider
the number of failures.
