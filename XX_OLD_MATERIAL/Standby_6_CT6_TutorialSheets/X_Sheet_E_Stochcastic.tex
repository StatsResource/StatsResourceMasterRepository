%% 104 - Sept - 2004 - Question 6 or 6
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item (i) State the expectation and variance of $dY t = Y t+h − Y t$ , the increment of the process Y t over a small interval of size h, conditional on Y t = y.

\item (ii) Calculate the expectation and variance of the increment X n+1 − X n of the autoregression, conditional on X n = y.

\item (iii) Find, by equating the first and second moments of the increments in (i) and (ii) above, an expression for the drift $\mu(y)$ of the approximating diffusion in a form which does not involve the time increment h.
\item 
(iv) State a condition under which the approximating process in (iii) is a Brownian motion with drift.
\item 
(v) State a condition under which the approximating process in (iii) is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.
