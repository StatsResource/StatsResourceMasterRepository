For the case of countable state space we put i , j   {\displaystyle i,j}  i,j in place of x , y   {\displaystyle x,y}  x,y. Kolmogorov forward equations read 
  {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial P_{ij}}{\partial t}}(s;t)=\sum _{k}P_{ik}(s;t)A_{kj}(t)} 
while Kolmogorov backward equations are 
{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial P_{ij}}{\partial s}}(s;t)=-\sum _{k}A_{ik}(s)P_{kj}(s;t)}  
The functions   {\displaystyle P_{ij}(s;t)} are continuous and differentiable in both time arguments. 

They represent the probability that the system that was in state    {\displaystyle i} at time {\displaystyle s}   jumps to state   {\displaystyle j}   at some later time   {\displaystyle t>s}  . 
The continuous quantities  {\displaystyle A_{ij}(t)}  satisfy 
 {\displaystyle A_{ij}(t)=\left[{\frac {\partial P_{ij}}{\partial u}}(t;u)\right]_{u=t},\quad A_{jk}(t)\geq 0,\ j\neq k,\quad \sum _{k}A_{jk}(t)=0.}
