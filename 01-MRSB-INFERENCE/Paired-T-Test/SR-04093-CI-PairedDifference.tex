A microbiologist measures the total growth in 24 hours of two strains of a germ culture  in the same petri dish. Nine identical specimens are prepared. The growth rate for the eight samples for each strain are tabulated below:

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline 
		Specimen &	Strain 1	&	Strain 2	\\ \hline \hline
		1 & 212 & 224 \\ \hline
		2 & 234 & 231 \\ \hline
		3 & 214 & 209 \\ \hline
		4 & 236 & 243 \\ \hline
		5 & 221 & 231 \\ \hline 
		6 & 212 & 216 \\ \hline
		7 & 202 & 213 \\ \hline 
		8 & 210 & 216 \\ \hline
		9 & 248 & 242 \\ \hline
	\end{tabular} 
\end{center}
\noindent At a significance level of 5\%, is there sufficient evidence to state that there is any difference in growth rates between the two strains.
