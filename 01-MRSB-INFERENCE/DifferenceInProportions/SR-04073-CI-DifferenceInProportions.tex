\section*{Question 9}
A coal-fired power plant is considering two different systems for pollution abatement.
The first system has reduced the emission of pollutants to acceptable levels 68\% of the time,
as determined from 200 air samples. The second, more expensive system has reduced the
emission of
pollutants to acceptable levels 70\% of the time, as determined from 250 air samples. lf the
expen sive system is significantly more eilective than the inexpensive system in reducing the
pollutants to acceptable levels, then the management of the power plant will install the
expensive system.

\begin{itemize}
\item  Which system will be installed if management uses a significance level of 0.05 in making
its decision?
\item  Construct a 95\% confidence interval for the difference in the two proportions. Interpret
this interval.
\end{itemize}
