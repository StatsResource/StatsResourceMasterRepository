Question 2. An insurance company wants to estimate the percentage of drivers who talk on their mobile phones while driving. 
A random sample of 850 drivers results in 544 who talk on their mobile phones while driving.
(a) Find the point estimate of the percentage of all drivers who talk on their cell phones while driving.
(b) Find a 95% interval estimate of the percentage of all drivers who talk on their cell phones while driving. 
Question 3. 
A study finds that a percentage of 40% of IT users out of a random sample of 400 in a large community preferred one web browser to all others.

In another large community, 30% of IT users out of a random sample of 300 prefer the same web browser.

Compute a 95 percent confidence interval for the difference in the proportion of IT users who prefer this particular web browser.
