\section*{Question 10}
It is generally assumed that older people are more likely to vote for the Conservatives than younger people. In a survey, 160 of 400 people over 40 and 120 of 400 people under 40 stated they would vote Conservative. 
\begin{itemize}
\item  Do the data support this hypothesis at a significance level of 5\%?
\item  Calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the difference between the proportion of people over 40 voting Conservative and the proportion of people below 40 voting Conservative. 
\end{itemize}
