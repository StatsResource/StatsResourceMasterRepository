\noindent \textbf{Worked Example Null and Alternative Hypotheses}
%------------------%
{
%%- \frametitle{Hypothesis Testing}
%%	Question 3.1 (a)\\
	There are 200 students on course A and another 200 students on course B.  On the final exam, the 200 students on course A scored a mean mark of 68 with a standard deviation of 20, while those on course B obtained a mean mark of 73 with a standard deviation of 18.  
	(Hint: This is a test of whether that the means of the two groups are the same)
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[(i)] Clearly state your null and alternative hypotheses.
		\item[(ii)] Is this a One Tail or Two Tail test?
	\end{itemize}
	
\subsubsection{Worked Example}
%	Question 3.1 (b)\\
A Health and Safety survey of 200 industrial accidents revealed that 53 
were due to untidy working conditions.  

A factory manager claims that the above sample is just a “one off”, and that less than 20\% of accidents are a result of untidy working conditions. 

(Hint: This is a test of whether the nominal proportion is too low)
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(i)] Clearly state your null and alternative hypotheses.
	\item[(ii)] Is this a One Tail or Two Tail test?
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Worked Example}
%	Question 3.1 (d) \\

\begin{itemize}
	\item 	A survey was carried out to investigate absenteeism in the building industry.
	Data on the number of sick days per year and type of job (unskilled or skilled)
	were collected for a random sample of employees.
	\item The mean number of sick days for 50 unskilled workers was 3.8 days with a standard deviation of 2.6 days. 
	\item The mean number of sick days for 60 skilled workers was 3 days with a standard deviation of 2.2 days. 
	\item (Hint: This is a test of whether that the means of the two groups are the same)
	
	\item Clearly state your null and alternative hypotheses.
	Is this a One Tail or Two Tail test?
\end{itemize}	

\subsubsection{Worked Examples} 

A coal-fired power plant is considering two different systems for pollution abatement. The first system has reduced the emission of pollutants to acceptable levels 68\% of the time, as determined from 200 air samples. The second, more expensive system has reduced the emission of
pollutants to acceptable levels 70\% of the time, as determined from 250 air samples. lf the expen sive system is significantly more eilective than the inexpensive system in reducing the pollutants to acceptable levels, then the management of the power plant will install the expensive system.

\subsubsection{Worked Example}
%	Question 3.1 (c) \\
Based on birth records for millions of babies, the percentage of newborn babies in Sweden that are female is 51\%. A group of researchers in Sweden are interested in finding out if women who suffer from severe morning
sickness are more likely to have a girl. 

The researchers looked at records for 1000 women admitted to hospital for
severe morning sickness and determined that 560 of these women gave birth
to a female baby.  [Source: Lancet 354: 2053, 1999].

	\subsubsection{Worked Example}
	%%Question 3.1 (g)\\    
	A firm that produces lightbulbs claim that their products last on average 1000 hours. An independent study took a random sample of 150 lightbulbs, and found the average burning time to be 990 (with a standard deviation of 60)

	\subsubsection{Worked Example}
	%	Question 3.1 (e)\\
	An environmental group states that “fewer than 60\% of industrial plants comply with air pollution standards”. An independent researcher takes a sample of 60 plants and finds that 33 are complying with air pollution standards.

	\subsubsection{Worked Example}	
	%	Question 3.1 (f) \\ 
	A claim has been made that the mean body temperature of healthy adults is equal to 98.6? Fahrenheit. A sample of 106 people has produced a mean body temperature of 98.2? Fahrenheit and a standard deviation of 0.62.

\section{Two Sample Means}
%==============================================================%
Tutorial Question: 
A research company is comparing cars on the basis of fuel consumption.
Given the following data:
%==============================================================%
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
		&	Type A	&	Type B	\\	\hline
		Sample Size	&	11	&	10	\\	\hline
		Sample Meab	&	Mean 8.3miles/L	&	9.6miles/L	\\	\hline
		Standard Deviation 	&	1.99m.iles/L	&	2.37miles/ L	\\	\hline
	\end{tabular} 
	
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Test at a 0.05 level of significance that the fuel consumption is the same for both types of car.
	
	\item Suppose that the sample sizes in Q3 were 110 and 100 respectively. Again test at a 0.05 level of significance that the fuel consumption is the same for both types of car.
\end{itemize}
