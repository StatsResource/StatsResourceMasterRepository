\textbf{Confidence Interval for a Mean (Small Sample)}
\begin{itemize}
\item  The mean operating life for a random sample of $n = 10$ light bulbs is $\bar{x} = 4,000$ hours, with the sample
standard deviation $s = 200$ hours. \item  The operating lifetimes of bulbs in general is assumed to be approximately normally distributed.\item 
We estimate the mean operating life for the population of bulbs from which this sample was taken, using a 95 percent
confidence interval as follows:

\[4,000\pm(2.262)(63.3)  = (3857,4143)\]

The general structure of a confidence interval is as follows:

\[ \mbox{Point Estimate}  \pm \left[ \mbox{Quantile} \times \mbox{Standard Error} \right] \]


\begin{itemize}
\item Point Estimate: estimate for population parameter of interest, i.e. sample mean, sample proportion.
\item Quantile: a value from a probability distribution that scales the intervals according to the specified confidence level.
\item Standard Error: measures the dispersion of the sampling distribution for a given sample size $n$.
\end{itemize}
\end{framed}


\item The point estimate is 4,000 hours. 
\item The sample standard deviation is 200 hours, and the sample size is 10. 

\item We use the sample mean $s$ as an estimate for population standard deviation $\sigma$.

Hence \[S.E(\bar{x} ) = { 200 \over \sqrt{10}} = 63.3\]

\item  From last slide, the t quantile with $df=9$ is 2.262.
\end{itemize}
