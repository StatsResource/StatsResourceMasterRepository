	\item \textbf{Single Sample t-test for Means (Small Sample) } % 10 Marks
	The mean and standard deviation of the salaries of 16 Irish full-time workers are 5000 and
	3000, respectively.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[(i)] Test the hypothesis that the mean salary of all Irish full-time workers is 4000 at a significance level of 5\%.
		\item[(ii)] What assumption is made in this testing procedure? Is this assumption reasonable?
	\end{itemize}

	%%	Question 3.1 (a)\\
	There are 200 students on course A and another 200 students on course B.  On the final exam, the 200 students on course A scored a mean mark of 68 with a standard deviation of 20, while those on course B obtained a mean mark of 73 with a standard deviation of 18.  
	(Hint: This is a test of whether that the means of the two groups are the same)
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[(i)] Clearly state your null and alternative hypotheses.
		\item[(ii)] Is this a One Tail or Two Tail test?
	\end{itemize}
