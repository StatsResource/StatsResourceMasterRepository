\section{Inference Procedure: Worked Examples}



b)The mean and variance of height in a sample of 25 Irish students are 174cm and 100cm2, respectively.

i)Test the hypothesis that the mean height of all Irish students is 170cm at a significance level of 5%.

\subsection*{Confidence Interval for a Mean (Small Sample)}

*  The mean operating life for a random sample of $n = 10$ light bulbs is $\bar{x} = 4,000$ hours, with the sample
standard deviation $s = 200$ hours. *  The operating life of bulbs in general is assumed to be approximately normally distributed.


We estimate the mean operating life for the population of bulbs from which this sample was taken, using a 95 percent
confidence interval as follows:

\[4,000\pm(2.262)(63.3)  = (3857,4143)\]

*  The point estimate is 4,000 hours. The sample standard deviation is 200 hours, and the sample size is 10. Hence \[S.E(\bar{x} ) = { 200 \over \sqrt{10}} = 63.3\]

*  From last slide, the t quantile with $df=9$ is 2.262.
