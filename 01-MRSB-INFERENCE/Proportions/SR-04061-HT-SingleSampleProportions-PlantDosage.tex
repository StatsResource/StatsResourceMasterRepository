\subsection*{Q4. Confidence Interval for a Proportion}
The strength of dosage of a plant growth enhancement chemical is often measured by the proportion of plants that grow faster. A particular dosage of the chemical is fed to 119 plants of these plants, 97 actually show faster growth.

\begin{itemize}
	\item[i.]  Calculate a point estimate $\hat{p}$ for the proportion of plants that grow faster due to the dosage. 									 
	\item[ii.]  What is the standard error of the estimate? 			
	\item[iii.] Find a 95\% confidence interval for the proportion. 					
\end{itemize}
