\subsection*{Question 2}
A company claims that it pays men and women equally. The salaries for some randomly selected employees (in thousands) were recorded and the results were as follows:\\
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
&&\\[-0.4cm]
& Male & Female \\
\hline
&&\\[-0.4cm]
sample size & 5 & 3 \\
mean salary & 30.2 & 28.4 \\
standard deviation & 1.7 & 1.9 \\
\hline
\multicolumn{3}{c}{}\\[-0.3cm]
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\item The F-test was carried out and a p-value of 0.7297 was obtained. What does this mean? 

 \item We wish to test the hypothesis that there is no difference between salaries - what are the null and alternative hypotheses? 
 \item If testing at the 10\% level, what is the rejection region? (note your answer to part (a)). 
 \item Is there evidence to suggest gender inequality?
