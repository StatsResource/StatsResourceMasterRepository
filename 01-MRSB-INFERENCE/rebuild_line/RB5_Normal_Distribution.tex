The amount of time required for routine automobile transmission service is normally distributed with the mean 45 minutes and the standard deviation 8.0 minutes. 
	
	The service manager plans to have work begin on the transmission of a customerâ€™s car 10 min after the car is dropped off, and the customer is told that the car will be ready within 1 hour total time (i.e. after  the car is dropped off). 
	
	What is the probability that the service manager will be wrong?

\section*{Solution}
\[X \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2) \]
\begin{framed}
\noindent \textbf{Compute the Z-Score}
\[ z_{o} = \frac{ x_{o} - \mu}{\sigma} \]
\end{framed}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $P(X\leq x_{o}) = P(Z \leq z_{o})$
    \item $P(Z \leq -z_{o} = P(Z \geq z_{o})$
\end{itemize}
