\large  In a study of company salaries, salaries paid by 2 different IT companies were randomly selected.
 
 \begin{itemize}
 \item For 40 Deltatech employees the mean is 23,870 and the standard deviation is 2960.
 \item For 35 Echelon employees , the mean is 22,025 and the standard deviation is 3065.
 \end{itemize}
 
 At the 0.05 level of significance, test the claim that Deltatech employees earn the same as their  Echelon counterparts.
