\section{Exercise} The following are measurements (in mm) of a critical
dimension on a sample of twelve engine crankshafts:

\begin{verbatim}
224.120 224.001 224.017 223.982 223.989 223.961
223.960 224.089 223.987 223.976 223.902 223.980
\end{verbatim}
(a) Calculate the mean and standard deviation for these data.
(b) The process mean is supposed to be ? = 224mm. Is this the
case? Give reasons for your answer.
(c) Construct a 99\% confidence interval for these data and interpret.
(d) Check that the normality assumption is valid using 2 suitable plots.

\begin{verbatim}
> x<-c(224.120,224.001,224.017,223.982 ,223.989 ,223.961,
+ 223.960 ,224.089 ,223.987 ,223.976 , 223.902 ,223.980)
>
> mean(x)
[1] 223.997
>
> sd(x)
[1] 0.05785405
>
> t.test(x,mu=224,conf.level=0.99)

One Sample t-test

data:  x
t = -0.1796, df = 11, p-value = 0.8607
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 224
99 percent confidence interval:
223.9451 224.0489
sample estimates:
mean of x
223.997

\end{verbatim}
\section{Exercise 2} 
The height of 12 Americans and 10 Japanese was measured. Test for a difference in the heights of both populations.
\begin{verbatim}
Americans
174.68   169.87    165.07    165.95 204.99 177.61 
170.11  170.71    181.52 167.68 158.62 182.90
Japanese
158.76  168.85  159.64  180.02  164.24
161.91  163.99  152.71  157.32  147.20
\end{verbatim}


\section{Exercise 3}

A large group of students each took two exams. The marks obtained in both exams by a sample of eight students is given below

\begin{verbatim}
Student12345678
Exam 15776473962564981
Exam 26781624957615971
\end{verbatim}
Test the hypothesis that in the group as a whole the mean mark gained did not vary according to the exam against the hypothesis that the mean mark in the second exam was higher
\begin{verbatim}
>
> Ex1<-c(57,76,47,39,62,56,49,81)
> Ex2<-c(67,81,62,49,57,61,59,71)
> t.test(Ex1-Ex2)

One Sample t-test

data:  Ex1 - Ex2
t = -1.6733, df = 7, p-value = 0.1382
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
-12.065666   2.065666
sample estimates:
mean of x
-5
\end{verbatim}

\section{Exercise 4}
A poll on social issues interviewed 1025 people randomly selected from the United States. 450 of people said that they do not get enough time to themselves. A report claims that over 41\% of the population are not satisfied with personal time. Is this the case?

\begin{verbatim}

> prop.test(450,1025,p=0.40,alternative="greater")

1-sample proportions test with continuity correction

data:  450 out of 1025, null probability 0.4
X-squared = 6.3425, df = 1, p-value = 0.005894
alternative hypothesis: true p is greater than 0.4
95 percent confidence interval:
0.413238 1.000000
sample estimates:
p
0.4390244
\end{verbatim}

Exercise 23b:  A company wants to investigate the proportion of males and females promoted in the last year. 45 out of 400 female candidates were promoted, while 520 out of 3270 male candidates were promoted. Is there evidence of sexism in the company?
\begin{verbatim}
> x.vec=c(45,520)
> n.vec=c(400,3270)
>  prop.test(x.vec,n.vec)

2-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction

data:  x.vec out of n.vec
X-squared = 5.5702, df = 1, p-value = 0.01827
alternative hypothesis: two.sided
95 percent confidence interval:
-0.08133043 -0.01171238
sample estimates:
prop 1    prop 2
0.1125000 0.1590214

\section{Exercise}

Generate a histogram for data set 'scores', with an accompanying box-and-whisker plot.
The colour of the histogram's bar should be yellow. The orientation for the boxplot should be horizontal.

\begin{verbatim}
scores <-c(23,19,22,22,19,20,25,26,26,19,24,23,17,21,28,26)

par(mfrow=c(2,1)) # two rows , one column

hist(scores,main="Distribution of scores",xlab="scores",col="yellow")

boxplot(scores ,horizontal=TRUE)

par(mfrow =c(1,1)) #reset
\end{verbatim}
