\subsection*{Question 11}
%%	\noindent \textbf{MA4413 Autumn 2008 paper}

A model of an on-line computer system gives a mean times to retrieve a record from a direct access storage system device of 200 milliseconds, with a standard deviation of 58 milliseconds. If it can assumed that the retrieval times are normally distributed:

\begin{itemize}
	\item[(i)] What proportion of retrieval times will be greater than 75 milliseconds?
	\item[(ii)] What proportion of retrieval times will be between 150 and 250 milliseconds?
	\item[(iii)] What is the retrieval time below which 10\% of retrieval times will be?
\end{itemize}
