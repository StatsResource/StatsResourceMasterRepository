	\item 	\textbf{Single Sample Proportion Test } % 10 Marks
	A company organizes two evening courses, one on stock market trading and one on
	spread-betting. From a sample of 100 clients, 64 of them choose the stock market course.
	
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item Calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the percentage of clients who
		prefer the stock market course. (5 marks)
		\item lt is known that in past years the percentage of clients who preferred the
		stock market trading classes was 75\%. Should the company conclude that
		the interest in the stock market trading courses has decreased significantly in
		comparison to past years? Clearly state $H_0$ and $H_1$.
	\end{enumerate}
	\newpage 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Provide an estimate of the difference between the population
		proportions (i.e. $\pi_l -\pi_2$).
		\item Calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the difference between the
		population proportions.
		\item Use a 0.05 significance level to determine if there is a difference
		between the two proportions. [Clearly state the null and alternative hypotheses
		and your conclusion].
	\end{enumerate}
