\begin{document}

Two time-sharing systems are compared according to their response
time to an editing command. 
\begin{itemize} 
\item The mean response time of 100 requests
submitted to system 1 was measured to be 600 milliseconds with a
known standard deviation of 20 milliseconds. \item  The mean response time
of 100 requests on system 2 was 592 milliseconds with a known
standard deviation of 23 milliseconds. \end{itemize} 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item sing a significance level of $5\%$,
test the hypothesis that system 2 provides a faster response time than
system 1.  Clearly state your null and alternative hypotheses and your
conclusion.
\end{enumerate}
