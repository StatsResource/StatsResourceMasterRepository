 	\item  A bank is concerned about the amount of debt being accrued by customers using its credit
 	cards. The board of directors voted to institute an expensive monitoring system if the mean for all
 	the bank’s customers is greater than €2000. The bank randomly selected 50 credit-card holders and
 	determined the amounts they charged. For this sample group, the mean is €2177 and the standard ‘
 	deviation is € 1257. Using a 0.05 level of significance,  test the claim that the mean amount charged
 	is greater than €2000. Will the monitoring system be implemented?
