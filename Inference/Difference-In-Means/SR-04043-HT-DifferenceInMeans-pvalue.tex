\section*{Question 3 (Two Sample Means - One Tailed)}
The average mass of a sample of 64 Irish teenagers (Let say - 18 year old males) was 73.5kg with a variance of 100kg$^2$. 
The average mass of an equivalent sample of 81 Japanese teenagers was 68.5kg with a variance of 81 kg$^2$. 
\begin{itemize}
\item  Test the hypothesis that Irish students are larger (in terms of mass) than Japanese teenagers.
%\item  By calculating the appropriate $p-$value, test the null hypothesis that the mean mass of 
%all Irish students is 70kg at significance levels of 5\%. 
%\item  Using the appropriate confidence interval, test the hypotheses that the average mass of all Irish students is a) 70kg, b) 72kg, c) 75kg at a significance level of 5\%.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\textit{Standard Error Formula}}
\[ S.E.(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2)  = \sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}} \]
\[ S.E.(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2)  = \sqrt{\frac{10^2}{64} + \frac{9^2}{81}}  = \sqrt{2.56} = 1.6\]
