\section*{Question 8 - Two Sample Means}
Deltatech software has 350 programmers divided into two groups with 200 in Group A
and 150 in Group B. In order to compare the efficiencies of the two groups, the
programmers are observed for 1 day.
%------------------%
\begin{itemize}
\item The 200 programmers in Group A averaged 45.2 lines of code with a standard
deviation of 8.4.
\item The 150 programmers in Group B averaged 42.7 lines of code with a standard
deviation of 5.2.
\end{itemize}
%------------------%
Let $\bar{x}_A$ denote the average number of lines of code per day produced by programmers in
Group A and
let $\bar{x}_A$ be the corresponding statistic for Group B.
Provide an estimate of $\mu_A â€”\mu_B$ and calculate an approximate 95\% confidence interval for
%------------------%

Test the claim that Group A are more efficient than Group B by
\begin{itemize}
\item  Interpreting the 95\% confidence interval.
\item  Computing the appropriate test statistic.
%\item  Computing the appropriate p-value.
\end{itemize}
