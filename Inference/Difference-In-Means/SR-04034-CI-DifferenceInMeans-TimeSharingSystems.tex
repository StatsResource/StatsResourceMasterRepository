\noindent Two time-sharing systems are compared according to their response time to an editing command. The mean response time of 100 requests submitted to system 1 was measured to be 600 milliseconds with a known standard deviation of 20 milliseconds. \\
\noindent The mean response time of 100 requests on system 2 was 592 milliseconds with a known standard deviation of 23 milliseconds. 
\medskip
 

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Using a significance level of 5\%,
 test the hypothesis that system 2 provides a faster response time than
 system 1. Clearly state your null and alternative hypotheses and your
 conclusion.
\end{enumerate}
