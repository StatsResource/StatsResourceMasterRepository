\subsection{Example 2}

\begin{itemize}
\item The average height of 100 Irish students was 1.72m and the variance 0.0144m2.
\item 
Calculate 95\% and 99\% confidence intervals for the average height of the population of Irish students.
\end{itemize}

 
Variance :  0.0144m2.    Standard deviation is therefore 0.12m
estimate : sample mean  1.72m
sample size : 100  (large sample)
 
\begin{itemize}
\item 95\% confidence , therefore  = 0.05
\item two tailed procedure, therefore k = 2
\item therefore column to use = 0.025
\end{itemize}
 
   Large sample
   degrees of freedom =  i.e. bottom row
 
  therefore t-value is 1.96
       99\% confidence ,
       therefore  = 0.01
       two tailed procedure, therefore k = 2
       therefore column to use = 0.005
 
       Large sample
       degrees of freedom =  i.e. bottom row
 
       therefore t-value is 2.576
                      

Standard Error (from Formulae)     sn        =0.12100       =0.012m
95\% Confidence Interval : estimate(t-valuestd. error)
 
                           \[ 1.72\pm (1.96 \times 0.012) =\]
 

99\% Confidence Interval : estimate(t-valuestd. error)
 
                     \[1.72(2.576\times 0.012) =\]
