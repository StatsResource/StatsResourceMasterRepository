\section*{Question 4 (Two Sample Means, small samples, one tailed)}
The working lifetimes of 100 of both of two different types of batteries were observed. The mean lifetime for the sample of type 1 batteries was 25 hrs with a standard deviation of 4hrs. The mean lifetime for the sample of type 1 batteries was 23 hrs with a standard deviation of 3hrs. 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
\hline 
Type 1 & Type 2 \\ \hline \hline
$n_1$ = 100 & $n_2$ = 100 \\ \hline
$x_1$ = 25 hours & $x_1$ = 23 hours \\ \hline
$s_1$ = 4 hours & $s_1$ = 3 hours \\ \hline
\end{tabular} 
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Test the hypothesis that the mean working lifetimes of these batteries do not differ at a significance level of 5\% .

\item  Calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the difference between the average working lifetimes of these batteries. 
\item  Using this confidence interval, test the hypothesis that battery 1 on average works for 3 hours longer than battery 2.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\textit{Standard Error Formula}}
\[ S.E.(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2)  = \sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}} \]
\[ S.E.(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2)  = \sqrt{\frac{4^2}{100} + \frac{3^2}{100}}  \]
