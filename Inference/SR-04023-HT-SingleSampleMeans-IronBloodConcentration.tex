\subsubsection*{Part A - Single Sample Inference Procedures (15 Marks)}
Mean blood iron concentration for children with adequate nutrition is taken to be 110mg/dl. \\ \smallskip

\noindent 25 randomly selected children from a disadvantaged urban area were given blood tests. The mean concentration of iron from this sample was 98 mg/dl with a standard deviation of 25.5 mg/dl.



\medskip
 

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the mean concentration of iron for children in this area. 
\item Interpret this confidence interval.  Do these results provide evidence that children in this area suffer from iron deficiency? 
\item Test this hypothesis using a 5\% level of significance. Formally state your null and alternative hypotheses.
\end{enumerate}
