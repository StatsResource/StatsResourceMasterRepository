\section*{Question 9 - Two Sample Proportions}
In a recent British election 40.12\% of the voters voted for the Labour party. A survey of 98 people indicated that 49 of them wish to vote for the Labour party. 
\begin{itemize}
\item  Does this figure indicate that support for the Labour party has changed at a significance level of 5\% (calculate the realisation of the appropriate test statistic)? 
\item  Calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the present support of the Labour party. Comment on your result taking your conclusion from part i) into account. 
\end{itemize}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%


\noindent \textbf{The Test Statistic}
\begin{itemize}
\item The Test statistic is therefore
\[ TS = {\mbox{observed} - \mbox{null} \over \mbox{Std. Error}}  = {1 - 0 \over 0.377 } = 2.65 \]
\item Two Tailed Test, therefore $k = 2$, and $\alpha = 0.05$. Also two large samples. The CV is 1.96.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Decison Rule}
\textbf{Decision Rule}
\[ |TS| > CV ?  \]
\begin{itemize}
\item If Yes: Reject the null Hypothesis
\item If No : Fail to reject the Null Hypothesis
\end{itemize}
