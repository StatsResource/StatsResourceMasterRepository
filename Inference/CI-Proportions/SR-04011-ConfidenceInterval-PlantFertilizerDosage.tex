\item 
The strength of dosage of a plant growth enhancement chemical is often measured by the proportion of plants that grow faster. A particular dosage of the chemical is fed to 115 plants of these plants, 94 actually show faster growth.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item  Calculate a point estimate $\hat{p}$ for the proportion of plants, $\pi$, that grow faster due to the dosage. 									 
\item  What is the standard error of the estimate? 			
\item  Find a 95\% confidence interval for $\pi$. 				
% \item What size sample is required to give the estimate in (c) to within $\pm1\%$. 	
%\item Carry out a testing procedure to investigate the claim that the chemical is 90\% effective. 	
\end{enumerate}

The general structure of a confidence interval is as follows:

\[ \mbox{Point Estimate}  \pm \left[ \mbox{Quantile} \times \mbox{Standard Error} \right] \]


\begin{itemize}
\item Point Estimate: estimate for population parameter of interest, i.e. sample mean, sample proportion.
\item Quantile: a value from a probability distribution that scales the intervals according to the specified confidence level.
\item Standard Error: measures the dispersion of the sampling distribution for a given sample size $n$.
\end{itemize}
