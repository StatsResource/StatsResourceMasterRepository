\subsection{Difference between two population proportions}
When we wish to test the hypothesis that the proportions in two
populations are not different, the two sample proportions are
pooled as a basis for determining the standard error of the
difference between proportions. Note that this differs from the
procedure used in Section 9.5 on statistical estimation, in which
the assumption of no difference was not made.

Further, the present procedure is conceptually similar to that
presented in Section 11.1, in which the two sample variances are
pooled as the basis for computing the standard error of the
difference between means. The pooled estimate of the population
proportion, based on the proportions obtained in two independent
samples
