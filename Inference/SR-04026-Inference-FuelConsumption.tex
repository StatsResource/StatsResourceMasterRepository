 \textbf{Independent Sample Means (Small Samples) hypothesis Test }
	A research company is comparing cars on the basis of fuel consumption.
	Given the following data:
	%==============================================================%
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
			&	Type A	&	Type B	\\	\hline
			Sample Size	&	11	&	10	\\	\hline
			Sample Meab	&	Mean 8.3miles/L	&	9.6miles/L	\\	\hline
			Standard Deviation &	1.99m.iles/L	&	2.37miles/ L	\\	\hline
		\end{tabular} 
		
	\end{center}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Test at a 0.05 level of significance that the fuel consumption is the same for both types of car.
		
		\item Suppose that the sample sizes in Q3 were 110 and 100 respectively. Again test at a 0.05 level of significance that the fuel consumption is the same for both types of car.
