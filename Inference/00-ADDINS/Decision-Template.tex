\noindent \textbf{What are the conclusions}
\begin{itemize} 

\item[Yes:] We \textbf{reject the Null} Hypothesis. \\ \textit{We have sufficient evidence against Null Hypothesis.}

\item[No:] We \textbf{fail to reject} Null hypothesis. \\ \textit{We do not have sufficient evident against Null Hypothesis.}
\end{itemize}
{\normalsize
N.B. Note the terminology that we are using. Also note exactly what our conclusion is: We are talking about strength of evidence, rather than what is true or false.}

\begin{framed}
\begin{itemize}
\item If $TS > CV$ , where $CV$ is a critical value corresponding to the sample size and confidence level, then reject the null hypothesis. 
\item  If $TS \leq CV$ , we fail to reject. null hypothesis. i.e. Not enough evidence. 
\end{itemize}
