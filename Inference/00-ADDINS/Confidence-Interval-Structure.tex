The general structure of a confidence interval is as follows:

\[ \mbox{Point Estimate}  \pm \left[ \mbox{Quantile} \times \mbox{Standard Error} \right] \]


\begin{itemize}
\item Point Estimate: estimate for population parameter of interest, i.e. sample mean, sample proportion.
\item Quantile: a value from a probability distribution that scales the intervals according to the specified confidence level.
\item Standard Error: measures the dispersion of the sampling distribution for a given sample size $n$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Computing Confidence Intervals}
Confidence limits are the lower and upper boundaries / values of a confidence interval, that is, the values which define the range of a confidence interval. The general structure of a confidence interval is as follows:

\[ \mbox{Point Estimate}  \pm \left[ \mbox{Quantile} \times \mbox{Standard Error} \right] \]


\begin{itemize}
\item Point Estimate: estimate for population parameter of interest, i.e. sample mean, sample proportion.
\item Quantile: a value from a probability distribution that scales the intervals according to the specified confidence level.
\item Standard Error: measures the dispersion of the sampling distribution for a given sample size $n$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Confidence interval of a mean (small sample)}

If the data have a normal probability distribution and the sample
standard deviation $s$ is used to estimate the population
standard deviation $\sigma$, the interval estimate is given by:
\begin{equation}
\bar{X} \pm t_{1-\alpha/2,n-1}\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
\end{equation}
where $t_{1-\alpha/2,n-1}$ is the value providing an area of $\alpha/2$ in the upper tail of a Studentâ€™s t distribution with n - 1 degrees of freedom.
