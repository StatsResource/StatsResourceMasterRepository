\subsection*{Difference in Two means}
For this calculation, we will assume that the variances in each of the two populations are equal. This assumption is called the assumption of homogeneity of variance.

The first step is to compute the estimate of the standard error of the difference between means ().

\[ S.E.(\bar{X}-\bar{Y}) = \sqrt{\frac{s^2_x}{n_x} + \frac{s^2_y}{n_y}} \]

\begin{itemize}
\item $s^2_x$ and $s^2_x$ is the variance of both samples.
\item $n_x$ and $n_y$ is the sample size of both samples.
\end{itemize}
The degrees of freedom is $n_x + n_y -2$.

\subsection*{Computing the Confidence Interval}
Standard Error for difference of two means (small aggregate sample)

\[ S.E.(\bar{x}-\bar{y}) = \sqrt{  s^2_p \left({1\over n_x}+{1\over n_y} \right)} \]

Pooled Variance $s^2_p$ is computed as:

\[ s^2_p = \frac{(n_x-1)s^2_x + (n_y-1)s^2_y}{(n_x-1) + (n_y-1)} \]
