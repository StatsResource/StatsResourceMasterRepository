\section*{Independent Sample Test for Means} 

% 10 Marks
\large 	
\noindent The height of 100 Americans and 50 Spaniards was observed. The mean and
	standard deviation of the height of the Americans was 172cm and 13cm,
	respectively. The mean and standard deviation of the height of the Spaniards
	was 167cm and 12cm, respectively.
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[(a)] Calculate a 99\% confidence interval for the difference between the mean height
		of all Americans and the mean height of all Spaniards.
		
		
		\item[(b)] Without doing any further calculations, test the hypothesis that the mean
		height of all Americans is equal to the mean height of all Spaniards. Give a brief
		justification of your conclusion. What is the significance level of this test'?
	\end{itemize}
