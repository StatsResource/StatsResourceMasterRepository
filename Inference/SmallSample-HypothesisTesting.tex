\section{Worked Example 3} Ten replicate analyses of the concentration
of mercury in a sample of commercial gas condensate gave the
following results (in ng/ml) :

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
	\hline
	23.3 & 22.5 & 21.9 & 21.5 & 19.9 & 21.3 & 21.7 & 23.8 & 22.6 &
	24.7\\
	\hline
\end{tabular}


Compute 95\% confidence limits for the mean.

 The dispensing machine at a well known soft drinks manufacture is 
 approximately normally distributed with a mean of 11.8 ozs and a standard 
 deviation of 0.1 ozs.
 
 If a can is chosen at random what is the probability that it contains more than 12 fluid ozs of liquid?
 
 EU Regulations require that 90\% of  cans sold must contain more liquid than stamped on the can by the manufacture.  You are the production engineer at the plant.  Given that the machine is delivering 11.8 ozs with a standard deviation of 0.1 ozs what would you set the stamping dial to in order to comply with EU regulation.
