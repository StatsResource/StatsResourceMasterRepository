It is estimated by a particular bank that 25\% of credit card customers pay only the minimum amount due on their monthly credit card bill and do not pay the total amount due. 50 credit card customers are randomly selected.
\begin{enumerate}
\item 	What is the probability that 9 or more of the selected customers pay only the minimum amount due?
\item  What is the probability that less than 6 of the selected customers pay only the minimum amount due?
\item 	What is the probability that more than 5 but less than 10 of the selected customers pay only the minimum amount due?
\end{enumerate}

Demonstration on Blackboard re: how to use tables in class.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $P(X \geq 9) = 0.9084$
\item $P(X < 6) = 1- P(X \geq 6) =1 - 0.9930 = 0.0070$
\item $P(6 \leq X \leq 9) = P(X \geq 6) - P(X \geq 10) = 0.9930 - 0.8363 = 0.1567$
\end{enumerate}
