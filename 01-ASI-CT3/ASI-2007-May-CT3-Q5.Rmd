The incidence of hospitalization tends to vary with the flu season over the years. 
Data on a particular group suggests that one should expect

*  one hospitalization in September;
*  one hospitalization in October;
*  two hospitalizations in November and
*  three hospitalizations in December.

Determine the probability that there are less than five hospitalizations in September to December period. 
Assume that hospitalizations each month are independent and follow Poisson distribution.

The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space. It is characterized by a single parameter, λ, which represents the average rate of occurrence of events.

In this case, we are given the average rate of hospitalizations for each month:

* September: λ = 1
* October: λ = 1
* November: λ = 2
* December: λ = 3

Since we are assuming that hospitalizations each month are independent, we can calculate the total average rate of hospitalizations for the September to December period by simply adding the average rates for each month:

λ_total = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7

Now, we need to calculate the probability of having less than five hospitalizations in this period. 
This is equivalent to calculating the cumulative probability of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 hospitalizations.

The probability mass function of a Poisson distribution is given by:

P(X = k) = (λ^k * e^(-λ)) / k!

where:

* X is the random variable representing the number of events
* k is the specific number of events
* λ is the average rate of events
* e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)
* k! is the factorial of k

Using this formula, we can calculate the probabilities for each number of hospitalizations:

P(X = 0) = (7^0 * e^(-7)) / 0! ≈ 0.000912
P(X = 1) = (7^1 * e^(-7)) / 1! ≈ 0.006385
P(X = 2) = (7^2 * e^(-7)) / 2! ≈ 0.022348
P(X = 3) = (7^3 * e^(-7)) / 3! ≈ 0.052032
P(X = 4) = (7^4 * e^(-7)) / 4! ≈ 0.090253

Finally, we can calculate the cumulative probability by adding these probabilities together:

P(X < 5) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) ≈ 0.171930

Therefore, the probability of having less than five hospitalizations in the September to December period is approximately 0.171930.
