## Classifying Processes as ARIMA(p,d,q)

### a) X_{t} = 0.6 \epsilon_{t-1} + ε t
**ARIMA(0,0,1)**

* **p = 0:** There's no autoregressive term (X_{t-1}, X_{t-2}, etc.).
* **d = 0:** No differencing is needed.
* **q = 1:** There's a moving average term of order 1 (ε_{t-1}).

### b) X_{t} = 1.4X_{t-1} - 2 + ε t + 0.5 \epsilon_{t-3}
**ARIMA(1,0,3)**

* **p = 1:** There's an autoregressive term of order 1 (X_{t-1}).
* **d = 0:** No differencing is needed.
* **q = 3:** There's a moving average term of order 3 (ε_{t-1}, ε_{t-2}, ε_{t-3}).

### c) X_{t} = 1.4X_{t-1} - 0.4X_{t-2} + ε t + \epsilon_{t-1}
Classify each of the following processes as ARIMA(p,d,q), if possible:

a)

X_{t} = 0.6 \epsilon_{t-1} + ε t

b)

X_{t} =1.4X_{t}-2 + ε t + 0.5 \epsilon_{t-3}

c)

X_{t} =1.4X_{t-1} - 0.4X_{t}-2 + ε t + \epsilon_{t-1}

In each case εt denotes white noise with mean 0 and variance σ2.



**ARIMA(2,0,1)**

* **p = 2:** There are autoregressive terms of order 1 and 2 (X_{t-1}, X_{t-2}).
* **d = 0:** No differencing is needed.
* **q = 1:** There's a moving average term of order 1 (ε_{t-1}).

**Note:** The constant term (-2 in process b) doesn't affect the ARIMA classification.


## Understanding ARMA(2,3) Process

**ARIMA** stands for **AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average**. The numbers in parentheses (p, d, q) represent the order of the autoregressive (AR) part, the degree of differencing (d), and the order of the moving average (MA) part, respectively.

**In the given equation:**
* **X_{t} = 1.4X_{t-1} - 2 + ε t + 0.5 \epsilon_{t-3}**

### Autoregressive (AR) Part:
* **p = 2** because the current value, X_{t}, is dependent on the previous two values, X_{t-1} and X_{t-2}. This is indicated by the terms 1.4X_{t-1} and - 2 (which can be considered as a coefficient of X_{t-2}).

### Moving Average (MA) Part:
* **q = 3** because the current value, X_{t}, is also influenced by the current error term, ε_{t}, and the past three error terms, ε_{t-1}, ε_{t-2}, and ε_{t-3}. This is indicated by the terms ε t and 0.5 \epsilon_{t-3}.

**Therefore, the process is classified as ARMA(2,3).**

**Key points to remember:**
* The AR part indicates the dependence of the current value on past values.
* The MA part indicates the dependence of the current value on current and past error terms.
* The constant term (-2) doesn't affect the ARMA classification.
