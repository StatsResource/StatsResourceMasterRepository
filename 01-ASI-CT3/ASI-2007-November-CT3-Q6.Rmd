A continuous random variable X has the following pdf
\[f(x) = k x e^{-x/2}\]
; k is a constant. x >0

a) Find the value of k for f(x) to be a valid probability density function.
b) Find the cumulant generating function of X.
c) Using the cumulant generating function or otherwise, find the mean and
variance of X.



The given probability density function (PDF) is:

```
f(x) = kx e^(-x/2)
```

**Part a: Finding the value of k**

For a valid PDF, we must have:

```
∫f(x) dx = 1
```

Integrating the given PDF from 0 to infinity:

```
∫₀∞ kx e^(-x/2) dx = 1
```

Using integration by parts, we can find the integral:

```
k * [-2x e^(-x/2) - 4e^(-x/2)]₀∞ = 1
```

Evaluating the limits:

```
k * [0 + 4] = 1
```

Therefore, k = 1/4.

**Part b: Finding the cumulant generating function**

The cumulant generating function (CGF) is defined as:

```
K(t) = ln(M(t))
```

where M(t) is the moment generating function.

The moment generating function is defined as:

```
M(t) = E(e^(tx))
```

For the given PDF, we have:

```
M(t) = ∫₀∞ e^(tx) * (1/4) * x * e^(-x/2) dx
```

Simplifying:

```
M(t) = (1/4) * ∫₀∞ x * e^(-(1/2 - t)x) dx
```

Using integration by parts again, we can find the integral:

```
M(t) = (1/4) * [(2/(1 - 2t))^2]
```

Therefore, the CGF is:

```
K(t) = ln[(1/4) * (2/(1 - 2t))^2]
```

**Part c: Finding the mean and variance**

The mean and variance can be found using the CGF.

The mean is given by:

```
μ = K'(0)
```

where K'(t) is the first derivative of the CGF.

Differentiating the CGF:

```
K'(t) = 4/(1 - 2t)
```

Evaluating at t = 0:

```
μ = K'(0) = 4
```

The variance is given by:

```
σ² = K''(0)
```

where K''(t) is the second derivative of the CGF.

Differentiating K'(t):

```
K''(t) = 8/(1 - 2t)^2
```

Evaluating at t = 0:

```
σ² = K''(0) = 8
```

Therefore, the mean of X is 4 and the variance of X is 8.
