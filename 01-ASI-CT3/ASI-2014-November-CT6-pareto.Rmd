The Pareto distribution with parameters $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ has probability density function:

$$f(x)=\frac{\alpha\lambda^{\alpha}}{x^{\alpha+1}}, \quad x\geq\lambda$$

and cumulative distribution function:

$$F(x)=1-\left(\frac{\lambda}{x}\right)^{\alpha}, \quad x\geq\lambda$$

Let $D$ be the deductible. We want to find $D$ such that:

$$P(X\leq D)=0.2$$

where $X$ is the claim amount.

Substituting into the cumulative distribution function, we get:

$$1-\left(\frac{300}{D}\right)^{3}=0.2$$

Solving for $D$, we get:

$$D=300\left(1-0.2\right)^{-\frac{1}{3}}\approx 342.03$$

Therefore, the size of the deductible is approximately **342.03** (in thousands).

To calculate the average claim amount net of deductible, we need to calculate the expected value of $X-D$ given that $X>D$. The conditional probability density function of $X$ given that $X>D$ is:

$$f_{X|X>D}(x)=\frac{f(x)}{P(X>D)}, \quad x>D$$

Substituting into the formula for expected value, we get:

$$E\left[X-D|X>D\right]=\int_{D}^{\infty}(x-D)\frac{f(x)}{P(X>D)}dx$$

After some algebraic manipulation and integration, we get:

$$E\left[X-D|X>D\right]=\frac{\lambda}{\alpha-1}\left[1-\left(\frac{\lambda}{D}\right)^{\alpha-1}\right]$$

Substituting $\alpha=3$, $\lambda=300$, and $D=342.03$, we get:

$$E\left[X-D|X>D\right]\approx 106.07$$

Therefore, the average claim amount net of deductible is approximately **106.07** (in thousands).
