Consumer demand for milk X, in a Metropolitan area, is known to follow a Gamma distribution with pdf
\[{\begin{aligned}f(x;\alpha ,\lambda )&={\frac {\lambda ^{\alpha }x^{\alpha -1}e^{-\lambda x}}{\Gamma (\alpha )}}\quad {\text{ for }}x>0\quad \alpha ,\lambda >0,\\[6pt]\end{aligned} \]
It is given that the average demand is ‘a’ liters and the modal demand is ‘b’ liters (b < a).


1. Compute the mode in terms of $\alpha$  and $\lambda$
2. Given that $EX = \lambda \alpha$  , what is the variance of the demand in terms of a and b?
3. Compute the skewness of the demand when $\alpha  = 2$ and $\lambda = 2$

The mode of a Gamma distribution is given by:

\[Mode = \frac{\alpha - 1}{\lambda}\]

Therefore, we have:

\[b = \frac{\alpha - 1}{\lambda}\]

Rearranging, we get:

\[\lambda = \frac{\alpha - 1}{b}\]

Substituting this into the given equation for the mean, we get:

\[a = \lambda \alpha = \frac{\alpha - 1}{b} \cdot \alpha = \frac{\alpha^2 - \alpha}{b}\]

Solving for $\alpha$, we get:

\[\alpha^2 - \alpha - ab = 0\]

Using the quadratic formula, we get:

\[\alpha = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4ab}}{2}\]

Since $\alpha$ must be positive, we take the positive root:

\[\alpha = \frac{1 + \sqrt{1 + 4ab}}{2}\]

Substituting this into the equation for $\lambda$, we get:

\[\lambda = \frac{\alpha - 1}{b} = \frac{\sqrt{1 + 4ab}}{2b}\]


Therefore, the mode can be expressed in terms of $a$ and $b$ as:

\[Mode = \frac{\alpha - 1}{\lambda} = \frac{\sqrt{1 + 4ab} - 1}{2}\]

The variance of a Gamma distribution is given by:

\[Var(X) = \frac{\alpha}{\lambda^2}\]

Substituting the expressions for $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ in terms of $a$ and $b$, we get:

\[Var(X) = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 + 4ab}}{2}}{\left(\frac{\sqrt{1 + 4ab}}{2b}\right)^2} = \frac{ab}{\sqrt{1 + 4ab}}\]

---

The skewness of a Gamma distribution is given by:

\[Skewness(X) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\alpha}}\]

Substituting $\alpha = 2$, we get:

\[Skewness(X) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}\]
