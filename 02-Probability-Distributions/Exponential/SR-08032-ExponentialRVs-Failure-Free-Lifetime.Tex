\section*{Question 4}
A machine is said to have a mean failure free lifetime of 2000 hours. What is the probability that the machine will last:

\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] at least 1000 hours
\item[(ii)]at least 1500 hours
\item[(iii)]less than 800 hours
\item[(iv)]less than 1800 hours
\end{itemize}

\smallskip
\noindent Expected Value of an exponentially distributed random variable $X$, specifed with the \textbf{rate parameter} $\lambda$
\[ X \sim \mbox{exp}(\lambda)  \]
is computed using the following formula
\[ E(X) = \frac{1}{\lambda} \]
