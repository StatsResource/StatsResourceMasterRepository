\section*{Exponential Distribution: Worked Example}


\noindent Suppose that customers arrive at a filling station at the rate of 3 per hour. Given that a customer has just arrived, the time is takes for the next customer to arrive is called a \textbf{waiting time}. \\
\medskip 

\noindent Let $T$ be the symbol for the ``waiting times" variable. 

\noindent Suppose that a customer has just arrived.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)] \item What is the expected waiting time between customer arrivals? 
%%-- \item Compute $E(T)$
\item What is the variance of waiting times? 
%%--- \subitem Compute $\mbox{Var}(T)$.
	\item What is the probability that the next customer will arrive within the next fifteen minutes?
	\item What is the probability that no customers arrive in the next half hour?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Part (a)}

\noindent \textbf{Expected Value and Variance}

\begin{framed}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Expected Value (Exponential Mean): $E(X) = \mu$
    \item Rate Parameter (Lambda): $ \lambda  = \frac{1}{\mu} $
    \item Variance: $\operatorname{Var}(X) = \mu^2= \frac{1}{\lambda^2}$
\end{itemize}
\end{framed}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\operatorname{E}(X) = 1/\lambda = 20$ minutes.
    \item $\operatorname{Var}(X)$ = $1/(\lambda^2)$= 400 squared minutes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Part (b)}
\noindent Compute $P(X \leq 15)$ with $\lambda = 1/20$

\[ P(X \leq x) = 1 -e^{-\lambda x} \]


\begin{itemize}
	\item $ P(X \leq x) = 1- e^{-\lambda x} $
	\item $ P(X \leq 15) = 1 - e^{-15/20}  $
	\item $ P(X \leq 15) = 1- e^{-0.75} =  1- 0.4723$

\end{itemize} 

\[ P(X \leq 15) = 0.5276\]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Part (c)}
\noindent Compute $P(X \geq 30)$ with $\lambda = 1/20$

\[ P(X \geq x) = e^{-\lambda x} \]


\begin{itemize}
	\item $ P(X \geq x) =  e^{-\lambda x} $
	\item $ P(X \geq 30) = e^{-30/20}  $
	\item $ P(X \geq 30) =  e^{-1.5} $

\end{itemize} 

\[ P(X \geq 30) = 0.2231\]
