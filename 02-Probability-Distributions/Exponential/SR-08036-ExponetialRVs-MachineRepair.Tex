\section*{Question 4 - Exponential Distribution - Example}

An average of five calls per hour are received by a machine repair department. 
Beginning the observation at any point in time, compute the following probabilites

\begin{itemize} 
\item[(a)] that the first call 
for service will arrive within ten minutes.
\item[(b)] that the first call 
for service will not arrive for 30 minutes.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item $\mu$ = Average per hour = 5.0
\item $\lambda= \mu$ = Average per half hour = 2.5
\item $P(X \leq 2.5) $
\[P(X \leq 2.5) = 1 - e^{-2.5} = 1 - 0.08208 = 0.91792\]
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Exponential Distribution : Expected Value}\\
\smallskip
\noindent Expected Value of an exponentially distributed random variable $X$, specifed with the \textbf{rate parameter} $\lambda$
\[ X \sim \mbox{exp}(\lambda)  \]
is computed using the following formula
\[ E(X) = \frac{1}{\lambda} \]

\noindent
Jobs are sent to a printer at an average of 5 jobs per hour. 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item  What is the expected time between jobs? 
\item  What is the probability that the next job is sent within 6 minutes after the previous job?
