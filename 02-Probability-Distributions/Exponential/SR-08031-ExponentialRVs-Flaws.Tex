\section*{Question 3}
Each 500-ft roll of sheet steel includes two flaws on average. 
What is the probability that as the sheet steel is unrolled the first flaw occurs within the first 50-ft segment?

\[ X \sim \mbox{Exponential}(\lambda)\]

\noindent Cumulative Distribution Function
\[
P( X \leq k) = 1 -e^{-k\lambda }\]
\medskip 
\noindent Survival Function
\[
P( X \geq k) =e^{-k \lambda }\]

\noindent $\lambda$ is the exponential rate parameter.

\begin{itemize}
\item Average per 500-ft roll = 2.0
\item average per 50-ft segment = 2.0/10 = 0.20
\item $P(X \leq 50)$
\begin{eqnarray*} 
P(X \leq 50) &=& 1 - e^{-\lambda} \\
&=& 1 - e^{-0.20}\\ 
&=& 1-0.81873 \\
&=& 0.18127\\
