	\begin{itemize}
		\item The binomial probability distribution is a discrete probability distribution that has many applications.
		\item It is associated with a multiple step experiment that we call the binomial experiment.
	\end{itemize}
	
	A binomial experiment has the following properties.
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The experiment consists of a sequence of n identical trials.
		
		\item Two outcomes are possible at each trial. We refer to one as a success and the other as a failure.
		
		\item The probability of a success, denoted by p, does not change from trial to trial. Similarly the probability of a failure, denoted by 1-p, also does not change from trial to trial.
		
		\item The trials are independent.
	\end{enumerate}
	

	\textbf{Binomial Distribution: Expected Value and Variance}
	
	
	If the random variable X has a binomial distribution with parameters n
	and p, we write
	\[ X \sim B(n,p) \]
	
	Expectation and Variance
	If $X \sim B(n,p)$, then:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Expected Value of X : $E(X) = np$
		\item Variance of X : $Var(X) = np(1-p)$
	\end{itemize}
	
	Suppose n=3 and p=0.5 
	Then $E(X) = 1.5$ and $V(X) = 0.75$.
	
	Remark: Referring to the expected value and variance may be used to validate
	the assumption of a binomial distribution.

	%% \frametitle{The Binomial Distribution}
	
	
	In a binomial experiment our interest is in the number of successes occurring in the n trials.
	Binomial Probability Function
	
	In general, if the random variable X follows the binomial distribution with parameters n ∈ ℕ and p ∈ [0,1], we write X ~ B(n, p). The probability of getting exactly k successes in n trials is given by the probability mass function:
	
\[	f(k;n,p)=\Pr(X=k)={\binom {n}{k}}p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}\]
	for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., n, where
	
\[	{\binom {n}{k}}={\frac {n!}{k!(n-k)!}}\]
	is the binomial coefficient, hence the name of the distribution. 
	
	[Remark ; Provided in exam formulae. Please see pg 142]
	
	
	
	where
	
	= the probability of   successes in   trials
	
	= the number of trials
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The formula can be understood as follows: we want exactly k successes ($p^k$) and n − k failures $(1 − p)^{n − k}$.
		\item However, the k successes can occur anywhere among the n trials, and there are ${n \choose k}$ different ways of distributing k successes in a sequence of n trials.
	\end{itemize}
	
Binomial probability
	\[y \;=\; \frac{{n!}}{{k!\left( {n - k} \right)!}}p^k q^{n - k} \; = \; \left( {\begin{array}{*{20}c} n \\ k \\ \end{array}} \right)p^k q^{n -
		k}\]
	
\subsection{Mean and variance of Binomial distribution}
	
	$M_{bin} = np$  and $\sigma ^2 _{bin} = np(1-p)$
	
	For example, if the sample size is 12 and the probability of
	success is 0.25, the mean is $12 \times 0.25 = 3$ and the variance
	is $\sigma ^2 _{bin} = 12 \times 0.25 \times 0.75 = 2.25$.
