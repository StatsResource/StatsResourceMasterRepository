It is estimated by a particular bank that 25\% of credit card customers pay only the minimum amount due on their monthly credit card bill and do not pay the total amount due. 50 credit card customers are randomly selected.
\begin{enumerate}
\item (3 marks)	What is the probability that 9 or more of the selected customers pay only the minimum amount due?
\item (3 marks) What is the probability that less than 6 of the selected customers pay only the minimum amount due?
\item (3 marks)	What is the probability that more than 5 but less than 10 of the selected customers pay only the minimum amount due?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item $P(X \geq 9) = 0.9084$
\item $P(X < 6) = 1- P(X \geq 6) =1 - 0.9930 = 0.0070$
\item $P(6 \leq X \leq 9) = P(X \geq 6) - P(X \geq 10) = 0.9930 - 0.8363 = 0.1567$
\end{enumerate}
