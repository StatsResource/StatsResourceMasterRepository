\section{Review Question 8 :  Binomial Distribution}
Commuter trains have a probability 0.1 of delay
between Dublin and Maynooth. Supposing that the delays are all independent,
what is the probability that out of 10 journeys between Dublin and
Mullingar more than 8 do not have a delay.
\section*{Solution}


\begin{itemize}
\item Reconsider the question : What is the probability that there is less than 2 delays.
\item $X$ is the variable for `delays', with Binomial parameters $n=10$, $p=0.1$
\item $P(X < 2) = P(X \leq 1) = P(X=0)+P(X=1)$
\item $P(X=0)$
\[P(X=0)= {10 \choose 0} \times 0.1^0  \times 0.9^10 = 0.34868\]
\item $P(X=1)$
\[P(X=1)= {10 \choose 1} \times 0.1^1  \times 0.9^9 = 0.38742\]
\item $P(X < 2) = 0.38742 + 0.34868 = 0.73610.$
\end{itemize}
