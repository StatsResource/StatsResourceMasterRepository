\subsection{Question 3 : Binomial Distribution}

10\% of intended passengers dont show up. Each flight holds 50 people.

Binomial distribution with parameters n=50 and p = 0.1

From Murdoch Barnes Table 1 (third page of tables at back of book )


a) What is the probability that six people or more fail to show up.

P(X6) =0.3839


b) Less than three people fail to show up (i.e. X=0,1 or 2)

P(X < 3) = 1- P(X3) =    1 - 0.8883  = 0.1117 [ANS]


c) More than 2 but less than 8   (i.e. X = 3,4,5,6,7)

This is equal to $$P(X3) - P(X8) = 0.8883 -0.1221 =  0.7662$$
