\item[(c)] \textbf{\textit{Probability Distributions (9 Marks)}}\\
For a digital communication channel, the probability of a bit being received in error is $5\%$. Consider the case where 100 bits are transmitted. Answer the following questions.

\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] (3 marks)	What is the probability that the number of bits received in error is 5?
\item[(ii)] (3 marks) What is the probability that the number of bits received in error is greater than 10?
\item[(iii)] (3 marks) What is the expected value for the number of bit will be error. What is the variance for this value?
\end{itemize}

%\noindent(When answering, justify your answer with workings, or by reference to an axiom, theorem or rule.)




%\item[(d)] \textbf{\textit{Poisson Approximation of the Binomial Distribution (3 Marks)}}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item[(i)] (2 Marks) Describe how the Poisson distribution can be used to approximate the binomial distribution.
%\item[(ii)] (1 Mark) Explain the circumstances in which this approximation may be used in preference to the binomial distribution.
