\subsection*{Worked Example}
A company owns 400 laptops. Each laptop has a 2\% probability of not working. You randomly select 20 laptops for your salespeople.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item What distribution do you feel is appropriate here. Justify your answer. 
\item What is the probability that they will all work?
\item What is the probability that only one will be broken?
\item What is the probability that at least two will be broken? 
\end{enumerate}
\newpage 
\begin{framed}
If the random variable X follows the binomial distribution with parameters $n \in {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }$  and $p \in [0,1]$, we write $X \sim Bin(n, p)$. \\ \end{framed}

\noindent The probability of getting exactly $k$ successes in n independent Bernoulli trials is given by the probability mass function:

\[{\displaystyle f(k,n,p)=\Pr(k;n,p)=\Pr(X=k)={\binom {n}{k}}p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}}\]
for $k = 0, 1, 2, ..., n$, where

\[{\displaystyle {\binom {n}{k}}={\frac {n!}{k!(n-k)!}}}\]
is the binomial coefficient. 
\end{framed}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Number of independent trials: $n=10$
    \item Success
\end{itemize}
