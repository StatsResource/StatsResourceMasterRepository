\subsection*{Question 5 Binomial Distribution [3 Marks] } % 12 Marks
A biased coin yields `Tails' on $45\%$ of throws. Consider an experiment that consists of throwing this coin 5 times.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]  Evaluate the following term $^{5}C_3$.
\item[(b)]  Compute the probability of getting three `Tails' in this experiment.
\item[(c)]  Compute the probability of getting two `Heads' in this experiment.
\end{itemize}

\noindent(When answering, justify your answer with workings, or by reference to an
axiom, theorem or rule.)
