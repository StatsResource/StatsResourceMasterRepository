\begin{itemize}
	\item
	Let $p$ denote the probability of success in a Bernoulli trial, and so $q = 1 - p$ is the probability of failure.
	A binomial experiment consists of a fixed number of Bernoulli trials. \item A binomial experiment with $n$ trials and
	probability $p$ of success will be denoted by
	\[B(n, p)\]
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Binomial Distribution}



Binomial Probability Function

n general, if the random variable X follows the binomial distribution with parameters n ? ? and p ? [0,1], we write X ~ B(n, p). The probability of getting exactly k successes in n trials is given by the probability mass function:

\[f(k;n,p)=\Pr(X=k)={\binom {n}{k}}p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}\]
for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., n, where

\[{\binom {n}{k}}={\frac {n!}{k!(n-k)!}}\]
is the binomial coefficient, hence the name of the distribution.

where

= the probability of   successes in   trials

= the number of trials


\subsection{Probability Mass Function}
(Formally defining something mentioned previously)
\begin{itemize} \item a probability mass function (pmf) is a \textbf{\emph{function}}
	that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some
	value.
	\[P(X=k)\]
	\item The probability mass function is often the primary means of defining a discrete
	probability distribution
	\item It is conventional to present the probability mass function in the form of a table.
\end{itemize}
