\section{Binomial Examples}		
		\textbf{Binomial Example 1}
		Suppose a signal of 100 bits is transmitted and the probability of
		sending a bit correctly is 0.9. What is the probability of
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item  at least 10 errors
			\item  exactly 7 errors
			\item  Between 5 and 15 errors (inclusively).
		\end{enumerate}
		


		\begin{itemize}
			\item  Since the probability of success is 0.9. We consider the distribution
			of the number of failures (errors).
			\item  We reverse the definition of `success' and `failure'. Success is now defined as an error.
			\item  The probability that a bit is sent incorrectly is 0.1.
			\item  Let X be the total number of errors. $X \sim B(100, 0.1)$.
			\item  Answer : $P(X \geq 10) = 0.5487$.
			\item  $P(X = 7)=P(X \geq 7) - P(X \geq 8) =0.8828 - 0.7939 = 0.0889$.
			\item  $P(5 \leq X  \leq 15) = P(X \geq 5) - P(X \geq 16) =0.9763 - 0.0399 = 0.9364$
		\end{itemize}
		



\subsection{ Binomial Example 1}
	
	Suppose a die is tossed 5 times. What is the probability of getting exactly 2 fours?
	
	Solution: This is a binomial experiment in which the number of trials is equal to 5, the number of successes is equal to 2, and the probability of success on a single trial is 1/6 or about 0.167. Therefore, the binomial probability is:
	
	\[P(X=2) = ^5C_2 \times (1/6)^2 \times (5/6)^3 = 0.161\]
