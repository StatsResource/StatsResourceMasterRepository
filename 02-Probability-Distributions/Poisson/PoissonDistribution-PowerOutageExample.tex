\begin{itemize}
	
	\item Suppose that electricity power failures occur according to a Poisson distribution
	with an average of 2 outages every twenty weeks. \item Calculate the probability that there will
	not be more than one power outage during a particular week.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Solution:}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The average number of failures per week is: $m = 2/20 = 0.10$
	
	\item ``Not more than one  power outage" means we need to compute and add the probabilities for ``0 outages" plus ``1 outage".
\end{itemize}


\begin{framed}
Formula \[P(X = k) = e^{-m}\frac{m^k}{k!}\]
\end{framed}

\begin{itemize}
	
	\item $P(X = 0)$
	
	\[P(X = 0) = e^{-0.10} \times \frac{0.10^0}{0!} = e^{-0.10} = 0.9048\]
	
	
	\item $P(X = 1)$
	
	\[P(X = 1) = e^{-0.10}\times \frac{0.10^1}{1!} = e^{-0.10}\times 0.1 = 0.0905\]
	
	\item $P(X \leq 1)$
	
	\[P(X \leq 1) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) = 0.9048 + 0.0905 = 0.995\]
	
\end{itemize}
