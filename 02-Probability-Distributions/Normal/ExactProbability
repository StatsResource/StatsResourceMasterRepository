\frametitle{Exact Probability}
\large
\alert{Remarks:} This is for continuous distributions only.
\begin{itemize}
\item The probability that a continuous random variable will take an exact value is infinitely small.
We will usually treat it as if it was zero.
\item
When we write probabilities for continuous random variables in mathematical notation, we often retain the equality component (i.e. the "...or equal to..").\\
For example, we would write expressions $P(X \leq 2)$ or $P(X \geq 5)$.
\item
Because the probability of an exact value is almost zero, these two expression are equivalent to $P(X < 2)$
or $P(X > 5)$. \item The complement of $P(X \geq k)$ can be written as $P(X \leq k)$.
\end{itemize}
