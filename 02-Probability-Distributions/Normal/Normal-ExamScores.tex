	The distribution of the exam scores in a statistics distribution is normally distributed with mean $\mu=45$  and standard deviation 
	$\sigma=16$. Suppose you receive a mark of 49.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[(A)]
		What is the probability of someone scoring higher than you?
		
		\item[(B)] What percentage of people scored above the mean but lower than you?
	\end{itemize}
	%-------------------------------------------------------%
		\section*{Solution to part A}
	
	Let $X$ be the score variable in the statistics exam. We are asked to compute $P(X \geq 49)$.
\begin{itemize}	
\item Find the  ``z-score" corresponding to a score of 49, given that mean $\mu=45$ and standard deviation  $\sigma=16$ .
	
	\[ z_0  = \frac{x_0-\mu}{\sigma}   = \frac{49-45}{16}  = \frac{4}{16} =0.25\]
	
\item From Murdoch Barnes Table 3 we can find out the value of $P(Z \geq 0.25)$  . 
	
	
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item[$\ast$] note: 0.25 = 0.2 + 0.05
	\item[$\ast$] The row is 0.2
	\item[$\ast$] The column is 0.05
	\end{itemize}
	\[
	\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline
	& ....	& 0.04	& 0.05	 & 0.06	& .... \\ \hline
	0.0	&	& ....	& 0.4801 & ....	& 	\\ \hline
	0.1	&	& ....	& 0.4404 & ....& 	\\ \hline
	0.2	&	& ....	& \textbf{0.4013} & ....	& 	\\ \hline
	....	&	&	&	 & 	&	\\ \hline
	
	\end{array} \]
	
$P(X \geq 49)  = 0.4013$
\end{itemize}
	
		\section*{Solution to part B}
\begin{itemize}	
\item If the probability of scoring higher than you is 0.4013, the probability of scoring lower than you is 0.5987  
	(from the complement rule: 1 - 0.4013).
\item The mean score is 45. $X$ is symmetric, so we can say $P(X \geq 45) = P(X \leq 45) = 0.50$.
\item $P(45 \leq X \leq 49) = 0.0987$
\end{itemize}
