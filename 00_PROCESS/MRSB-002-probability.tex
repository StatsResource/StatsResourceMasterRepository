A pair of dice is thrown. Let X denote the minimum of the two numbers which occur.
Find the  distributions and expected value of X.


Let's analyze the problem step by step.

### 1. Find the distribution of \( X \):

Here, \( X \) denotes the number of heads that appear when the coin is tossed three times. This follows a binomial distribution with parameters \( n = 3 \) and \( p = 0.75 \).

The probability mass function (pmf) of a binomial distribution is given by:
\[ P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \]

where \( \binom{n}{k} \) is the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose \( k \) successes (heads) out of \( n \) trials (tosses).

We will calculate \( P(X = k) \) for \( k = 0, 1, 2, 3 \):

- For \( k = 0 \) (no heads):
\[ P(X = 0) = \binom{3}{0} (0.75)^0 (0.25)^3 = 1 \times 1 \times 0.015625 = 0.015625 \]

- For \( k = 1 \) (one head):
\[ P(X = 1) = \binom{3}{1} (0.75)^1 (0.25)^2 = 3 \times 0.75 \times 0.0625 = 0.140625 \]

- For \( k = 2 \) (two heads):
\[ P(X = 2) = \binom{3}{2} (0.75)^2 (0.25)^1 = 3 \times 0.5625 \times 0.25 = 0.421875 \]

- For \( k = 3 \) (three heads):
\[ P(X = 3) = \binom{3}{3} (0.75)^3 (0.25)^0 = 1 \times 0.421875 \times 1 = 0.421875 \]

Thus, the distribution of \( X \) is as follows:
\[ P(X = 0) = 0.015625 \]
\[ P(X = 1) = 0.140625 \]
\[ P(X = 2) = 0.421875 \]
\[ P(X = 3) = 0.421875 \]

### 2. Find the expectation \( E(X) \):

The expectation (or mean) of a binomial distribution \( X \) with parameters \( n \) and \( p \) is given by:
\[ E(X) = n \cdot p \]

Here, \( n = 3 \) and \( p = 0.75 \):
\[ E(X) = 3 \times 0.75 = 2.25 \]

### Summary:
- **Distribution of \( X \)**:
  \[
  \begin{aligned}
  &P(X = 0) = 0.015625 \\
  &P(X = 1) = 0.140625 \\
  &P(X = 2) = 0.421875 \\
  &P(X = 3) = 0.421875 \\
  \end{aligned}
  \]

- **Expectation \( E(X) \)**:
  \[ E(X) = 2.25 \]

I hope this helps! If you have any further questions or need more information, feel free to ask.
