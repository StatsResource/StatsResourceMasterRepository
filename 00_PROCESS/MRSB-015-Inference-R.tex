\item[(d)] \textbf{\textit{Inference Procedures with \texttt{R} (6 Marks)}}\\
The standard deviations of data sets $X$ and $Y$ are 10 and 9 respectively. 
An inference procedure was carried out to assess whether or not $X$ and $Y$ can be assumed to have equal variance.
<p>
\item[i.] Formally state the null and alternative hypothesis.

\item[ii.] The Test Statistic has been omitted from the computer code output. Compute the value of the Test Statistic.

\item[iii.]() What is your conclusion for this procedure? Justify your answer.

\item[iv.] Explain how a conclusion for this procedure can be based on the $95\%$ confidence interval.
