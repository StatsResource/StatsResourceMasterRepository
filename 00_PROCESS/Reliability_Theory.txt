\section{Survivorship Function}
The survivorship function (commonly denoted as R(t)) is the complement to the cumulative distribution function
(i.e., R(t)=1-F(t)); the survivorship function is also referred to as the reliability or survival function (since it describes the probability of not failing or of surviving until a certain time t
