There are two possible routes to a particular location. You take $R_1$ 80\% of the time and $R_2$ 20\% of the time. 

We assume that travel time has an exponential distribution and, furthermore, the average travel time is 0.25 hours if you take $R_1$ and 0.5 hours if you take $R_2$.

A. Calculate the probability that the journey takes more than 0.5 hours for each of the routes, i.e., $\Pr(T > 0.5\,|\,R_1)$ and $\Pr(T > 0.5\,|\,R_2)$ respectively. 

B.  Calculate $\Pr(T > 0.5)$. (hint: law of total probability) 

C.  Given that $T>0.5$ hours, what is the probability that you used $R_1$? (i.e., calculate $\Pr(R_1\,|\,T>0.5)$)

D.  Derive a general expression for $\Pr(R_1\,|\,T>t)$ and evaluate it at $t=0.25$, $t = 1$ and $t = 2$ respectively. Interpret the results.

### Exercise A. 

Calculate the probability that the journey takes more than 0.5 hours for each route.

Given that travel time has an exponential distribution, the probability density function is:

$$f(t) = \lambda e^{-\lambda t}$$

where $\lambda$ is the rate parameter.

For $R_1$, the average travel time is 0.25 hours, so $\lambda_1 = \frac{1}{0.25} = 4$.

For $R_2$, the average travel time is 0.5 hours, so $\lambda_2 = \frac{1}{0.5} = 2$.

The probability that the journey takes more than 0.5 hours is given by:

$$\Pr(T > t) = 1 - F(t) = e^{-\lambda t}$$

For $R_1$:

$$\Pr(T > 0.5\,|\,R_1) = e^{-4 \cdot 0.5} = e^{-2}$$

For $R_2$:

$$\Pr(T > 0.5\,|\,R_2) = e^{-2 \cdot 0.5} = e^{-1}$$

### Exercise B. 
Calculate $\Pr(T > 0.5)$.

Using the law of total probability:

$$\Pr(T > 0.5) = \Pr(T > 0.5\,|\,R_1) \Pr(R_1) + \Pr(T > 0.5\,|\,R_2) \Pr(R_2)$$

Given that:

$$\Pr(R_1) = 0.8$$
$$\Pr(R_2) = 0.2$$

We have:

$$\Pr(T > 0.5) = (e^{-2} \cdot 0.8) + (e^{-1} \cdot 0.2)$$

### C. 

**Given that $T>0.5$ hours, what is the probability that you used $R_1$?**

Using Bayes' theorem:

$$\Pr(R_1\,|\,T>0.5) = \frac{\Pr(T>0.5\,|\,R_1) \Pr(R_1)}{\Pr(T>0.5)}$$

Substituting the values:

$$\Pr(R_1\,|\,T>0.5) = \frac{e^{-2} \cdot 0.8}{(e^{-2} \cdot 0.8) + (e^{-1} \cdot 0.2)}$$

### Exercise D. 
Derive a general expression for $\Pr(R_1\,|\,T>t)$ and evaluate it at $t=0.25$, $t=1$, and $t=2$.

The general expression for $\Pr(R_1\,|\,T>t)$ is:

$$\Pr(R_1\,|\,T>t) = \frac{\Pr(T>t\,|\,R_1) \Pr(R_1)}{\Pr(T>t)}$$

Given that:

$$\Pr(T>t\,|\,R_1) = e^{-4t}$$
$$\Pr(T>t\,|\,R_2) = e^{-2t}$$

We have:

$$\Pr(T>t) = (e^{-4t} \cdot 0.8) + (e^{-2t} \cdot 0.2)$$

So:

$$\Pr(R_1\,|\,T>t) = \frac{e^{-4t} \cdot 0.8}{(e^{-4t} \cdot 0.8) + (e^{-2t} \cdot 0.2)}$$

---

Now evaluating at $t=0.25$, $t=1$, and $t=2$:

For $t=0.25$:

$$\Pr(R_1\,|\,T>0.25) = \frac{e^{-1} \cdot 0.8}{(e^{-1} \cdot 0.8) + (e^{-0.5} \cdot 0.2)}$$

For $t=1$:

$$\Pr(R_1\,|\,T>1) = \frac{e^{-4} \cdot 0.8}{(e^{-4} \cdot 0.8) + (e^{-2} \cdot 0.2)}$$

For $t=2$:

$$\Pr(R_1\,|\,T>2) = \frac{e^{-8} \cdot 0.8}{(e^{-8} \cdot 0.8) + (e^{-4} \cdot 0.2)}$$

### Interpretation of the results

- As $t$ increases, the probability that you took $R_1$ given that the journey took longer than $t$ decreases.
- This makes sense because $R_1$ generally has a shorter travel time, so the longer the travel time, the more likely it is that you took $R_2$, which has a longer average travel time.
