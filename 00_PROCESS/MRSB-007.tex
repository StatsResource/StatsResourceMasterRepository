\subsection*{Question 2}
%% Repeat 2005 (question 2)(b)	

* The compressive strength of concrete for fresh-water exhibition tanks has mean 5000 psi and standard deviation 240 psi. 

* Assuming that the compressive strength is normally distributed, calculate the probability that the compressive strength of a sample of concrete is less than 4900 psi.
