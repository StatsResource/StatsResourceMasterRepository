\subsection*{Question 2}
%% Repeat 2005 (question 2)(b)	

* The compressive strength of concrete for fresh-water exhibition tanks has mean 5000 psi and standard deviation 240 psi. 

* Assuming that the compressive strength is normally distributed, calculate the probability that the compressive strength of a sample of concrete is less than 4900 psi.


To calculate the probability that the compressive strength of a sample of concrete is less than 4900 psi, given a mean of 5000 psi and a standard deviation of 240 psi, we can use the properties of the normal distribution.

First, we need to find the z-score for 4900 psi. The z-score is calculated using the formula:

\[ z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \]

Where:
- \( X \) is the value we are interested in (4900 psi)
- \( \mu \) is the mean (5000 psi)
- \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation (240 psi)

Let's plug in the values:

\[ z = \frac{4900 - 5000}{240} = \frac{-100}{240} = -0.4167 \]

Now, we use the z-score to find the corresponding probability. We can look up the z-score of -0.4167 in a standard normal distribution table or use a calculator. The z-score of -0.4167 corresponds to a cumulative probability of approximately 0.3385.

Therefore, the probability that the compressive strength of a sample of concrete is less than 4900 psi is about 33.85%.

Does that make sense? If you need any further explanation, feel free to ask!
