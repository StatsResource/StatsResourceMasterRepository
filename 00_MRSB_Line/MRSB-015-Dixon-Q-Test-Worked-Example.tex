\subsection*{Dixon's Q test}

\begin{itemize}
    \item In statistics, \textbf{\textit{Dixon's Q test}}, or simply the Q test, is used for identification and rejection of outliers. \item This test should be used sparingly and never more than once in a data set.
    \item To apply a Q test for suspect data, arrange the data in order of increasing values and calculate Q as defined:

\[
Q_{TS} = \frac{\mbox{Gap}}{\mbox{Range}}
\]

Where gap is the absolute difference between the outlier in question and the closest number to it. 
\item If $Q_{TS} > Q_{CV}$, where $Q_{CV}$ is the critical value found in Statistical Tables, then reject the questionable point.
\end{itemize}


\newpage 

% Part A - Dixon Q Test (5 Marks)
\noindent Use the Dixon Q-test to determine if there is an outlier present in this sample data. You may assume
a significance level of 5\%.
\[ 133, 139, 159, 129, 123, 
  137, 142, 124, 132, 136\]
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item  State the null and alternative hypotheses for this test.
\item  Compute the test statistic?
\item  State the appropriate critical value.
\item  What is your conclusion to this procedure?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution}
Arrange the data set into \textbf{\textit{ascending}} order. Determine which value is the potential outlier.

\[\LARGE \{ 123, 124, 129, 132, 133, 136, 137, 139, 142, 159\} \]

\noindent Here the potential outlier is the maximum value, i.e. 159

\subsection*{Hypotheses}

We can formally state the null and alternative hypothesis as follows

\begin{description}
\item[H$_0$] There are no outliers present in the data.
\item[H$_1$] There is one outlier present (\textit{i.e. the largest value 159})
\end{description}

\subsection*{Test Statistic}

The test statistic for this procedure is as follows:

\[ Q_{TS} =  \frac{\mbox{Gap}}{\mbox{Range}} \]

\noindent The gap is the difference of the outlier from the next value. In this case , the next value is 142, so the gap is 
\[ \mbox{Gap} = 159 - 142 = 17\]
The range is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum value.
\[ \mbox{Range} =  159-123 =36\]

\[ Q_{TS} =  \frac{\mbox{Gap}}{\mbox{Range}} = \frac{17}{36} = 0.4722 \]

\subsection*{Critical Values}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Before we look at the critical value, we confirm the size of the data set is $n=10$.

\item The critical value can be determined from the following table. 

\item  The column to chose is the significance level (here 5\% or 0.05 ). The row to use is $n$, the number of items in the data set.

\item The Critical Value $Q_{CV} = 0.466$
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Rule}


\begin{itemize}
    \item 
 If the Test Statistic is greater than the Critical value, reject the null hypothesis
\[ Q_{TS} > Q_{CV}\]

\item  Otherwise we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
\item Here the Test Statistic ($0.4722$) is greater than the Critical Value ($0.466$). Therefore we proceed to reject the Null Hypothesis. 

\item At a 5\% significance level, there is sufficient justification to treat the maximum value, i.e. 159, as an outlier.
\end{itemize}
