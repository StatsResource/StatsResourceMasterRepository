\noindent Suppose a continuous uniform random variable $X$ has the following parameters
\begin{itemize}
\item minimum $a=1$
\item maximum $b=9$
\end{itemize}
\[ X \sim U(a=1,b=9)\]

\medskip
\subsection*{Exercises}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item What is the probability of $X$ being between $5$ and $8$?
    \item What is the probability of $X$ being greater than 7.2?
    \item What is the expected value and variance of $X$?
\end{enumerate}
\medskip
\subsection*{Part (a)}

What is the probability of $X$ being between $5$ and $8$? \\i.e. What is $P( 5 \leq X \leq 8 )$?


\begin{itemize}\item The lower bound $L$ is 5
\item The upper bound $U$ is 8
\end{itemize}


\[
P( L \leq X \leq U ) = { U - L \over b - a}
\]

\[
P( 5 \leq X \leq 8 ) = \boldsymbol{{ 8 - 5 \over 9 - 1} = { 3 \over 8} = 0.375}
\]
\subsection*{Part (b)}

What is the probability of $X$ being greater than $7.2$. This is equivalent to the probbability that $X$ is between $7.2$ and $9$?
\begin{itemize}\item The lower bound $L$ is 7.2
\item The upper bound $U$ is 9

\item Remark: $P( X \geq 7.2) = P(7.2 \leq X \leq 9 )$
\end{itemize}


\[
P( 7.2 \leq X \leq 9 ) = \boldsymbol{{ 9 - 7.2 \over 9 - 1} = { 1.8 \over 8} = 0.225}
\]

\subsection*{Part (c)}
The expected value of the continuous uniform distribution, denoted $\textrm{E}(X)$,  is  computed using the following formula

\vspace{0.1cm}

\[
\textrm{E}(X) = {(b + a) \over 2}
\]

\vspace{0.1cm}

For this worked example the expected value is

\[
\textrm{E}(X) = {(9 + 1) \over 2} =  {10 \over 2} = 5
\]
The variance of the continuous uniform distribution, denoted $\textrm{Var}(X)$,  is  computed using the following formula

\vspace{0.1cm}

\[
\textrm{Var}(X) = {(b - a)^2 \over 12}
\]

\vspace{0.1cm}

For this worked example the variance is

\[
\textrm{Var}(X) = {(9 - 1)^2 \over 12} =  {8^2 \over 12} = {64 \over 12} = 5.33
\]
