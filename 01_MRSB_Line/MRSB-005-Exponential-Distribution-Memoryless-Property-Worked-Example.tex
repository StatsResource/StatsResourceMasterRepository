\subsection*{Exponential Distribution Problem}
\noindent Suppose that the average waiting time for queuing in a bank is 10 minutes.



\begin{framed}
\large 
\noindent \textbf{Important Formulae}

\[ X \sim \mbox{Exp}(\lambda) \]

\noindent where $\lambda$ is the rate parameter, and is equal to $1/\mu$, where $\mu$ is the mean duration, i.e. the exponential mean.
\medskip 
\noindent \textbf{Cumulative Distribution Function}
\[
P( X \leq k) = 1 -e^{-k\lambda }\]

\medskip 

\noindent \textbf{Survival Function}
\[
P( X \geq k) =e^{-k \lambda }\]


\end{framed}

\noindent What is the probability that a customer will spend more than 15 minutes queuing in the bank?

\[
P (X \geq 15) = e ^{-15\lambda}
= e ^{-3 / 2}
= 0.22
\]
\bigskip

\noindent What is the probability that a customer will spend more than 15 minutes in the bank given that they are still in the bank after 10 minutes?

\begin{eqnarray*}
P (X \geq 15|X \geq 10) &=& \frac{P (X \geq 15)}{P (X \geq 10)}\\
&=& \frac{e ^{-15\lambda}}{e ^{-10\lambda}}\\
&=& \frac{e ^{-1.5}}{e ^{-1}}\\
&=& e ^{-1 / 2} = P (X \geq 5) \\
&=&  0.604\\
\end{eqnarray*}
