\noindent A drive-in banking service is modeled as an \textbf{M/M/1} queueing system with customer arrival rate 
of 2 per minute. It is desired to have fewer than 5 customers line up 99 percent of the time. How 
fast should the service rate be? 

\begin{framed}
\begin{itemize}
\item The average number of customers is denoted $L$
\item The average amount of time that a customer spends waiting for service is denoted $W_q$
    \item  The ratio ${\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}}$ is the traffic intensity of the system.
\end{itemize}
\end{framed}

\section*{Solution}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item From Eq. (9.14), 
a, a, 1 

\begin{eqnarray*}
P(5 \mbox{ or more customers in the system }) &=& \sum^{\infty}_{n=5}  p_{n}\\
&=& \sum^{\infty}_{n=5} p_{n}\\
&=& \sum^{\infty}_{n=5} p_{n}\\
&=& \rho^{5}\\
\end{eqnarray*}

= C pn = C (1 - p)pn = p5 p = - n=5 n=5 P 
\item In order to have fewer than 5 customers line up 99 percent of the time, we require that this probability be 
less than 0.01. Thus, 
\[ \rho^{5} =  \left(\frac{\lambda}{\mu}\right)^{5} \leq 0.01\]
from which we obtain \[ 
\mu^{5} \geq \frac{\lambda^5}{0.01}  = \frac{32}{0.011} = 3200\]

Therefore $\mu \geq 5.024$
\item Thus, to meet the requirements, the average service rate must be at least 5.024 customers per minute.
\end{itemize}
