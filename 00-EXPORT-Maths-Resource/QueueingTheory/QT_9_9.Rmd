To determine the required service rate for the M/M/1 queueing system, we need to ensure that the probability of having fewer than 5 customers in the system is at least 99%.

Given:
- Arrival rate, $$\lambda = 2$$ customers per minute.
- Desired probability, $$P(n < 5) \geq 0.99$$.

In an M/M/1 queue, the probability of having \( n \) customers in the system is given by:

$$ P(n) = (1 - \rho) \rho^n $$

where \( \rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu} \) is the traffic intensity, and \( \mu \) is the service rate.

The cumulative probability of having fewer than 5 customers is:

$$ P(n < 5) = \sum_{n=0}^{4} P(n) = \sum_{n=0}^{4} (1 - \rho) \rho^n $$

This can be simplified using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:

$$ P(n < 5) = (1 - \rho) \sum_{n=0}^{4} \rho^n = (1 - \rho) \frac{1 - \rho^5}{1 - \rho} = 1 - \rho^5 $$

We need this to be at least 0.99:

$$ 1 - \rho^5 \geq 0.99 $$

Solving for \( \rho \):

$$ \rho^5 \leq 0.01 $$
$$ \rho \leq 0.01^{1/5} $$
$$ \rho \leq 0.3981 $$

Since \( \rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu} \):

$$ \frac{2}{\mu} \leq 0.3981 $$
$$ \mu \geq \frac{2}{0.3981} $$
$$ \mu \geq 5.025 $$

Therefore, the service rate should be at least **5.025 customers per minute** to ensure that fewer than 5 customers line up 99% of the time.
