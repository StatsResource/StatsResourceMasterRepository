**Exam Question:**

**Question:**

**a)** Find the Laplace transform of the following integral equation:
$$$
y(t) = 1 + ∫[0, t] y(τ) dτ
$$$

**b)** Solve the integral equation using the Laplace transform method.

**Solution:**

**a) Laplace Transform of the Integral Equation**

Taking the Laplace transform of both sides of the equation, we get:

$$$
Y(s) = 1/s + 1/s * Y(s)
$$$

**b) Solving the Integral Equation**

Rearranging the equation to solve for Y(s):

$$$
Y(s) - (1/s)Y(s) = 1/s
$$$

Factor out Y(s):
$$$
Y(s)(1 - 1/s) = 1/s
$$$

Solve for Y(s):
$$$
Y(s) = 1 / (s - 1)
$$$

Taking the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s):
$$$
y(t) = e^t
$$$

Therefore, the solution to the integral equation is:
$$$
y(t) = e^t
$$$
