Question 1(a)

Upper Limit ;  $U = \mu + 3 \sigma$
Lower Limit ;  $L = \mu - 3 \sigma$

Standardisation
Apply the standardisation formula $ Z = \frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}$ 	to both limits

$ Z_u = \frac{(\mu + 3 \sigma)-\mu}{\sigma} = \frac{3 \sigma}{\sigma} = 3$ 
 
Similary

$ Z_L = \frac{(\mu - 3 \sigma)-\mu}{\sigma} = \frac{-3 \sigma}{\sigma} = -3$  

Probability of point being above Upper Limit
\[ P(Z \geq 3) = 0.00135 \]

From Murdoch Barnes Tables (page 13)  

Probability of point being below Lower Limit

\[ P(Z \leq -3) = P(Z \geq 3) = 0.00135 \]

To find   we use the “Property of Symmetry”

“Property of Symmetry” -   for any value A $P(Z \leq -A) = P(Z \geq A)$ 
							
Therefore 

Conclusion: 
Probability of point being outside the 3 Sigma limits is

P(Z \leq -3) + P(Z \geq 3) =0.00270 	(i.e. 0.27%)


Question 1(a)

Upper Limit ;  $U = \mu + 2 \sigma$
Lower Limit ;  $L = \mu - 2 \sigma$ 

Standardisation
Apply the standardisation formula $ Z = \frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}$ 	to both limits

$ Z_u = \frac{(\mu + 2 \sigma)-\mu}{\sigma} = \frac{2 \sigma}{\sigma} = 2$ 
 
Similary

$ Z_L = \frac{(\mu - 2 \sigma)-\mu}{\sigma} = \frac{-2 \sigma}{\sigma} = -2$  

 
Probability of point being above Upper Limit
\[ P(Z \geq 2) = 0.00270 \]

From Murdoch Barnes Tables (page 13)  

Probability of point being below Lower Limit

\[ P(Z \leq -2) = P(Z \geq 2) = 0.00270 \]

To find   we use the “Property of Symmetry”

“Property of Symmetry” -   for any value A $P(Z \leq -A) = P(Z \geq A)$ 
							
Therefore 

Conclusion: 
Probability of point being outside the 2 Sigma limits is

P(Z \leq -2) + P(Z \geq 2) =0.00270  =0.04550 	(i.e. 4.55%) Question 1(b)

Q1. (a) A tyre manufacturer claims that under normal driving conditions, the tread life of a certain tyre follows a normal distribution with mean 50,000 miles and standard deviation 5000 miles. 

(i) If your tyres wear out at 45,000 miles, would you consider this unusual? Support your answer with an appropriate probability calculation using the normal curve. [ 10 marks ] 

(ii) If the manufacturer sells 100,000 of these tyres and warrants them to last at least 40,000 miles, about how many tyres will wear out before the warranty expires? [ 10 marks ]

Part (i) Solution

Test Value ; 45,000km			Mean		 km	
						Standard Deviation	 km

Find  

Standardisation
Apply the standardisation formula	 	to test value
 

i.e.  = 

To find   we use the “Property of Symmetry”

“Property of Symmetry” -   for any value A

From Murdoch Barnes Tables (page 13)  

Therefore   = 0.1587 

“Complement Rule”		 =1-  for any given value A
	
 =1-  = 0.8413
Conclusion

15.87% of Tyres are expected to last less than 45,000km
	
84.13% of Tyres are expected to last longer than 45,000km




Part (i) Solution

Lower Limit ; 40,000km			Mean		 km	
						Standard Deviation	 km

Find  

Standardisation
Apply the standardisation formula	 	to limit
 

i.e.  = 

To find   we use the “Property of Symmetry”

“Property of Symmetry” -   for any value A
	 

From Murdoch Barnes Tables (page 13)  

Therefore   = 0.02275 

Conclusion
2.275% of Tyres are expected to last less than 40,000km

Of a Batch of 100,000 tyres,  2270 tyres will wear out before the warranty expires.
