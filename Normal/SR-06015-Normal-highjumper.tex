(b)	A student is practising for an upcoming high jump event.  The height that she will clear each time she jumps is normally distributed with a 
mean of 72 inches and a standard deviation of 4 inches.  
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] (1 Mark) 	What is the probability that the jumper will clear 76 inches or higher on a single jump?
\item[(ii)] (1 Mark) 	What is the probability that the height she jumps is between 68 and 76 inches on a single jump?
\item[(iii)] (1 Mark) 	What is the minimum height she must jump in order for the jump to be in the highest 10%?
\end{itemize}

\item The length of the jump of an athlete has a normal distribution with mean 7m and standard deviation 0.1m. Calculate the probability that she jumps
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item at least 7.15m
\item no more than 7.15m
\item between 7.1m and 7.20m 
\item Find the probability that if she jumps 3 times all the jumps will be less than 7.15m (assume the lengths of the jumps are independent). 
\end{enumerate}
