Assume that the length of injected moulded plastic components are normally distributed with a mean of 10mm and a standard deviation of 2mm.  
Draw a rough sketch and then calculate corresponding probability for the following measurements occurring on an individual component:

\begin{itemize} 
	\item[(i)]	Between 10 and 12.4mms
	\item[(ii)]	Less than 9.7 mms
	\item[(iii)]	Between 9.8 and 10.1 mms
	\item[(iv)]	Less than 10.3 mms
\end{itemize}


Assume that the length of injected moulded plastic components are normally distributed with a mean of 13.5 mm and a standard deviation of 2.5 mm.  Calculate the corresponding probability for the following measurements occurring on an individual component.

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item (3 Marks)	Greater than 10.5 mms,
\item (2 Marks) Greater than 15.2 mms,
\item (3 Marks) Between 12.2 and 15.2 mms,
\item (2 Marks) Less than 10.3 mms.
\end{enumerate}
\noindent You may illustrate each of your answers with a sketch.

\section*{Solution}
\[X \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2) \]
\begin{framed}
\noindent \textbf{Compute the Z-Score}
\[ z_{o} = \frac{ x_{o} - \mu}{\sigma} \]
\end{framed}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $P(X\leq x_{o}) = P(Z \leq z_{o})$
    \item $P(Z \leq -z_{o} = P(Z \geq z_{o})$
\end{itemize}
