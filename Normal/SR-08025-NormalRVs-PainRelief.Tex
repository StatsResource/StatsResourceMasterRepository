\large  \noindent	The period of pain relief reported by people treated with a drug is normally distributed with a Mean of 50 hours and a Standard Deviation of 16 hours.  \\
\medskip
\noindent  In a random sample of 64 people treated with the drug, what is the probability that the mean period of relief reported is between 48 and 53 hours?

\subsection*{Solution}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Let $X$ denote
    \item The mean $\mu = $ and the standard deviation $\sigma = $
\[  X \sim N(\mu = 50, \sigma^2 = 16^2) \]
\end{itemize}


\section*{Solution}
\[X \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2) \]
\begin{framed}
\noindent \textbf{Compute the Z-Score}
\[ z_{o} = \frac{ x_{o} - \mu}{\sigma} \]
\end{framed}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $P(X\leq x_{o}) = P(Z \leq z_{o})$
    \item $P(Z \leq -z_{o} = P(Z \geq z_{o})$
\end{itemize}
